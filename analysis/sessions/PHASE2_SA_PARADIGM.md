# SA- Root Paradigm Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Operation**: MINOS Phase 2 - Paradigm Investigation
**Status**: ANALYSIS COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This investigation analyzes all SA- initial words in the Linear A corpus to determine whether they form a coherent paradigm analogous to the K-R paradigm (KU-RO/KI-RO). The findings suggest a **partial paradigm** with SA-RA₂ as the dominant form (20 occurrences), but with significant functional divergence among SA- variants.

**Key Finding**: SA-RA₂ (Akkadian *šarāku* "to allocate") stands alone as an allocation marker. Other SA- forms (SA-RO, SA-RU, SA-MA) do NOT consistently share its semantic field.

## 1. Corpus Data: SA- Forms

### 1.1 Frequency Distribution

| Form | Occurrences | Sites | Primary Context |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| **SA-RA₂** | 20 | HT only | Before COMMODITY + NUMERAL |
| **SA-RU** | 6 | HT only | After NUMERAL, before NUMERAL |
| **SA-MA** | 4 | HT (3), ZA (1) | After NUMERAL, before NUMERAL |
| **SA-RO** | 4 | HT only | Mixed contexts |
| **SA-RA** | 2 | HT (1), SAMW (1) | Before TE marker |
| **SA-QE-RI** | 1 | HT | Before KU-RO |
| **SA-JA-MA** | 1 | HT | After NUMERAL, before NUMERAL |
| **SA-TA** | 1 | HT | After KU-RO |
| **SA-RI** | 1 | ZA | Fragmentary |
| **SA** (alone) | 5 | HT | After COMMODITY logogram |

**Total SA- words**: 45 occurrences across 9+ distinct forms

### 1.2 Comparison with K-R Paradigm

| Pattern | K-R Paradigm | SA- Pattern |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Dominant form | KU-RO (37) | SA-RA₂ (20) |
| Secondary form | KI-RO (16) | SA-RU (6) |
| Ratio dominant:secondary | 2.3:1 | 3.3:1 |
| Total variants | 6 forms | 9+ forms |
| Paradigm coherence | **HIGH** | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

## 2. Detailed Form Analysis

### 2.1 SA-RA₂ (20 occurrences) - CONFIRMED PROBABLE

**Status**: Primary allocation marker (Akkadian *šarāku*)

**Corpus Evidence**:
```
HT18:    [SA-RA₂] GRA 10
HT28a:   [SA-RA₂] OLE+DI 1
HT28b:   [SA-RA₂] GRA 20
HT30:    [SA-RA₂] CYP |
HT90:    I-KU-RI-NA | [SA-RA₂] GRA 20
HT94a:   KU-RO 110 | [SA-RA₂] CYP 5
HT100:   KU-RO 97 | [SA-RA₂] CYP 5
HT102:   KA-PA | [SA-RA₂] GRA 976
HT114a:  KI-RI-TA₂ | [SA-RA₂] GRA 10
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Position**: ALWAYS precedes COMMODITY logogram + NUMERAL
- **Commodities**: GRA (45%), CYP (25%), OLE (5%), other (25%)
- **Preceding elements**: KU-RO (total), personal names, numerals
- **Function**: Transaction category marker = "allocated portion of"

**Hypothesis Testing**:
| Hypothesis | Support | Score |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Semitic (*šarāku*) | SUPPORTED | 1.3 |
| Luwian | POSSIBLE | 1.0 |
| Pre-Greek | WEAK | 1.0 |
| Proto-Greek | NEUTRAL | 0 |

**Confidence**: PROBABLE (converging evidence, no bilingual confirmation)

---

### 2.2 SA-RO (4 occurrences) - POSSIBLE

**Corpus Evidence**:
```
HT9a:     [SA-RO] | TE
HT17:     [SA-RO] 10 |
HT19:     [SA-RO] 5 ½
HT42+59:  [SA-RO] OLE+KI 8
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Position**: Mixed - precedes TE marker (1x), numerals (2x), commodity (1x)
- **Commodities**: OLE+KI (1x only)
- **Function**: NOT consistent allocation marker

**Hypothesis Testing**:
| Hypothesis | Support | Score |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Semitic | WEAK | 1.3 |
| Luwian | POSSIBLE | 1.0 |
| Pre-Greek | WEAK | 1.0 (vowel alternation) |
| Proto-Greek | WEAK | 0.5 (-o ending) |

**Key Observation**: SA-RO appears before TE in HT9a, similar to SA-RA and SA-MA. This "TE" pattern may be significant.

**Relationship to SA-RA₂**: UNCERTAIN - only 1/4 occurrences shows commodity context

**Confidence**: POSSIBLE (limited data, inconsistent pattern)

---

### 2.3 SA-RU (6 occurrences) - POSSIBLE

**Corpus Evidence**:
```
HT86a:      [SA-RU] 20 |
HT86b:      [SA-RU] 20 |
HT94b:      [SA-RU] 1 |
HT95a:      [SA-RU] 20 |
HT95b:      [SA-RU] 10 |
HT123+124a: [SA-RU] OLIV 16
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Position**: Followed by NUMERAL (5x) or COMMODITY (1x)
- **Commodities**: OLIV (1x only)
- **Special feature**: Appears in HT94b, same tablet as SA-RA₂ (HT94a)
- **Context**: Often in simple numeral-to-numeral sequences

**Hypothesis Testing**:
| Hypothesis | Support | Score |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Luwian | SUPPORTED | 2.0 (quotative particle variant) |
| Semitic | WEAK | 1.3 |
| Pre-Greek | NEUTRAL | 0 |
| Proto-Greek | NEUTRAL | 0 |

**Key Observation**: SA-RU mostly precedes plain numerals, not commodities. This suggests a different function from SA-RA₂.

**Critical Data Point**: In HT123+124a, sequence is:
```
KI-RO .3 | SA-RU OLIV 16
```
This is the ONLY occurrence where SA-RU precedes a commodity logogram.

**Confidence**: POSSIBLE (function unclear, may be personal name or different term)

---

### 2.4 SA-MA (4 occurrences) - POSSIBLE

**Corpus Evidence**:
```
HT6b:   [SA-MA] 35 |
HT10a:  [SA-MA] 4 |
HT52a:  [SA-MA] | TE
ZA10b:  [SA-MA] 5 |
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Position**: Before numerals (3x) or TE marker (1x)
- **Commodities**: NONE directly follow SA-MA
- **Sites**: HT (3x) + ZA (1x) - shows broader geographic distribution

**Hypothesis Testing**:
| Hypothesis | Support | Score |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Semitic | SUPPORTED | 2.7 (Akkadian *šamnu* "oil", Hebrew *šemen*) |
| Luwian | POSSIBLE | 1.0 |
| Pre-Greek | NEUTRAL | 0 |
| Proto-Greek | NEUTRAL | 0.25 (-a ending) |

**Semitic Etymology**: The Semitic connection to *šamnu/šemen* ("oil, fat") is intriguing but problematic:
- SA-MA NEVER appears before OLE (oil) logogram
- SA-MA followed by numerals alone, not oil quantities
- If SA-MA meant "oil", why use SA-MA + number instead of OLE + number?

**Alternative Interpretation**: SA-MA may be:
1. Personal name (like SA-RU)
2. Different administrative category
3. Shortened form of longer word

**Confidence**: POSSIBLE (Semitic etymology suggestive but not consistent with usage)

---

### 2.5 Minor SA- Forms

#### SA-RA (2 occurrences)
```
HT62+73:   [SA-RA] | TE
SAMWa1:    JA-SA [SA-RA] TE 10
```
- Both appear before TE marker
- May be variant of SA-RA₂ or abbreviated form
- Too few occurrences to determine function

#### SA-QE-RI (1 occurrence - HAPAX)
```
HT11b:   [SA-QE-RI] | KA 30 | KU-RO 180
```
- Appears before KA and KU-RO (total)
- Triconsonantal structure (S-Q-R)
- **Semitic parallel**: *šaqaru* "to hire, lease" (Akkadian)?
- SPECULATIVE due to single occurrence

#### SA-JA-MA (1 occurrence - HAPAX)
```
HT31:   [SA-JA-MA] 30 |
```
- Extended form of SA-MA?
- JA infix suggests adjectival or agentive modification
- SPECULATIVE

#### SA-TA (1 occurrence - HAPAX)
```
HT117a:   KU-RO 10 | [SA-TA] | KU-KU-DA-RA
```
- Follows KU-RO (total)
- May be personal name or place name
- SPECULATIVE

#### SA-RI (1 occurrence - HAPAX)
```
ZA21b:   [SA-RI] |
```
- Fragmentary context
- Only occurrence at Zakros
- SPECULATIVE

## 3. Paradigm Structure Assessment

### 3.1 Vowel Alternation Pattern

| Form | Second Syllable Vowel | Count | Pattern |
|------|----------------------|-------|---------|
| SA-RA₂ | /a/ | 20 | Dominant |
| SA-RO | /o/ | 4 | Minor |
| SA-RU | /u/ | 6 | Secondary |
| SA-MA | /a/ (different C2) | 4 | Different root? |
| SA-RI | /i/ | 1 | Hapax |

**K-R Paradigm Comparison**:
- K-R shows clear U/I vowel contrast: KU-RO (37) vs KI-RO (16)
- SA- shows A/U/O variation without clear functional differentiation

### 3.2 Consonant Variation

| Root | Forms | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| SA-R- | SA-RA₂, SA-RO, SA-RU, SA-RI, SA-RA | 5 variants, 33 total occ. |
| SA-M- | SA-MA, SA-JA-MA | 2 variants, 5 total occ. |
| SA-Q- | SA-QE-RI | 1 variant, 1 occ. |
| SA-T- | SA-TA | 1 variant, 1 occ. |

**Finding**: SA-R- is the productive root; SA-M-/SA-Q-/SA-T- may be separate lexemes.

### 3.3 Functional Distribution

| Function | SA-RA₂ | SA-RO | SA-RU | SA-MA |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Before COMMODITY + NUM | **20/20** | 1/4 | 1/6 | 0/4 |
| Before NUMERAL only | 0/20 | 2/4 | 5/6 | 3/4 |
| Before TE | 0/20 | 1/4 | 0/6 | 1/4 |
| After KU-RO | 2/20 | 0/4 | 0/6 | 0/4 |

**Conclusion**: SA-RA₂ has DISTINCT functional profile from other SA- forms.

---

## 4. Co-occurrence Analysis

### 4.1 SA- Forms on Same Tablets

| Tablet | SA- Forms Present | Relationship |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| HT94 | SA-RA₂ (a), SA-RU (b) | Different sides, different functions |
| HT123+124 | SA-RU (a) | Only one SA- form |
| HT28 | SA-RA₂ (a,b) | Consistent allocation function |

**Finding**: When multiple SA- forms appear, they are on DIFFERENT sides (a vs b), suggesting different record sections.

### 4.2 SA-RA₂ and K-R Forms

| Tablet | Sequence |
|--------|----------|
| HT94a | KU-RO 110 | SA-RA₂ CYP 5 |
| HT100 | KU-RO 97 | SA-RA₂ CYP 5 |
| HT130 | SA-RA₂ CYP | RA₂ | KU-RO SI-CYP 8 |

**Pattern**: SA-RA₂ often appears AFTER KU-RO (total), introducing a new allocation section.

---

## 5. Commodity Associations

### 5.1 By SA- Form

| Form | GRA | CYP | OLE | OLIV | VIR | Other | None |
|------|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-------|------|
| SA-RA₂ | 9 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 |
| SA-RO | 0 | 0 | 1* | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| SA-RU | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| SA-MA | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 |

*OLE+KI (oil variant)

### 5.2 Interpretation

**SA-RA₂**: Multi-commodity allocation marker (grain, copper, oil)
- NOT restricted to single commodity type
- Supports "allocate" (*šarāku*) rather than specific commodity name

**Other SA- forms**: No consistent commodity association
- May be personal names, other administrative terms, or damaged/misread

---

## 6. Multi-Hypothesis Assessment

### 6.1 Semitic (Akkadian) Analysis

| Form | Possible Cognate | Semantic Fit | Functional Fit |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| SA-RA₂ | *šarāku* "allocate" | STRONG | **STRONG** |
| SA-RO | *šarru* "king"? | WEAK | WEAK |
| SA-RU | *šarru* "king"? | WEAK | WEAK |
| SA-MA | *šamnu* "oil" | MODERATE | **WEAK** |
| SA-QE-RI | *šaqaru* "hire"? | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE |

**Verdict**: Only SA-RA₂ shows strong functional alignment with Semitic etymology.

### 6.2 Luwian/Anatolian Analysis

| Form | Possible Cognate | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| SA | Coordinative conjunction | Would explain SA alone |
| SA-RU | Quotative particle *-ru* | Luwian shows *-ru* suffixation |

**Verdict**: Luwian provides alternatives for SA-RU but not SA-RA₂.

### 6.3 Pre-Greek Analysis

| Feature | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Vowel alternation | SA-RA₂/SA-RO/SA-RU shows a/o/u variation |
| Consonant clusters | No unusual clusters |

**Verdict**: Pre-Greek substrate features not prominent in SA- paradigm.

### 6.4 Proto-Greek Analysis

| Form | Greek Parallel | Assessment |
|------|----------------|------------|
| SA-RA₂ | None clear | WEAK |
| SA-RO | -ος ending? | WEAK |
| SA-MA | σῆμα "sign"? | Phonologically distant |

**Verdict**: Proto-Greek hypothesis not supported for SA- forms.

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 Is There a SA- Paradigm?

**PARTIAL YES** - but NOT parallel to K-R paradigm:

1. **SA-RA₂** is a DISTINCT administrative term (allocation marker)
2. **SA-RO, SA-RU, SA-MA** do NOT share SA-RA₂'s function
3. The SA- initial syllable may be coincidental across different lexemes
4. Only SA-R- forms (5 variants) show potential paradigmatic relationship

### 7.2 Paradigm Comparison

| Feature | K-R Paradigm | SA- "Paradigm" |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Functional coherence | HIGH (accounting terms) | LOW (mixed) |
| Vowel alternation meaning | PROBABLE (total vs deficit) | NOT EVIDENT |
| Geographic distribution | HT-dominant | HT-dominant |
| Clear Semitic etymology | Moderate (KU-RO=*kull*) | Strong for SA-RA₂ only |

### 7.3 Updated Readings

| Form | Proposed Reading | Confidence | Change |
|------|------------------|------------|--------|
| SA-RA₂ | "allocation" (*šarāku*) | **PROBABLE** | Confirmed |
| SA-RO | Personal name or variant | SPECULATIVE | NEW |
| SA-RU | Personal name or different term | SPECULATIVE | NEW |
| SA-MA | Personal name? | SPECULATIVE | NEW |
| SA-QE-RI | Administrative term? | SPECULATIVE | NEW (hapax) |

### 7.4 What the Data Does NOT Show

Following **First Principle #5 (Negative Evidence)**:

1. **No clear vowel alternation function** - Unlike K-R where U/I distinguish total/deficit
2. **No consistent commodity association** for SA-RO, SA-RU, SA-MA
3. **No geographic variation** - All SA- forms concentrated at HT
4. **No inflectional endings** distinguishing grammatical function

---

## 8. First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **P1 (Kober)** | PASS | Pattern analysis preceded interpretation |
| **P2 (Ventris)** | PASS | Rejected paradigm hypothesis when data inconsistent |
| **P3 (Anchors)** | PASS | Built from Level 3 anchors (logograms) |
| **P4 (Multi-Hyp)** | PASS | Tested all four hypotheses for each form |
| **P5 (Negative)** | PASS | Documented what data does NOT show |
| **P6 (Corpus)** | PASS | Verified across all occurrences |

---

## 9. Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Focus on SA-RA₂ as confirmed allocation marker
2. Do NOT treat SA-RO/SA-RU/SA-MA as paradigmatically related to SA-RA₂
3. Investigate the "TE" pattern (SA-RO | TE, SA-MA | TE, SA-RA | TE)

### Medium-Term
4. Test whether SA-RO, SA-RU, SA-MA are personal names
5. Compare with other two-syllable words followed by numerals
6. Cross-reference PU-RA₂ (2 occurrences) for -RA₂ suffix pattern

### Long-Term
7. Develop administrative vocabulary layer focusing on SA-RA₂ and KU-RO
8. Test SA-RA₂ = *šarāku* across newly discovered inscriptions
