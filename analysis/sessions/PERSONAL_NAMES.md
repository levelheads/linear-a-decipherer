# Personal Name Pattern Analysis in Linear A

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Analyst**: Linear A Decipherment System
**Status**: Analysis Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies patterns suggesting personal names in Linear A administrative texts. By applying structural criteria (position before numbers, mid-frequency distribution, typical syllable length), we identify several categories of probable personal names and onomastic patterns with potential linguistic affiliations.

## First Principles Pre-Flight Check

- [x] Analyze patterns BEFORE assuming language [P1]
- [x] Prepared to abandon hypothesis if evidence contradicts [P2]
- [x] Identified available anchors (position + number pattern) [P3]
- [x] Will test against all four linguistic hypotheses [P4]
- [x] Will consider what data DOESN'T show [P5]
- [x] Verified readings across corpus where applicable [P6]

## Methodology

### Name Identification Criteria

Personal names in administrative texts should exhibit:

1. **Positional criterion**: Appear BEFORE numbers (Name + Quantity pattern)
2. **Frequency criterion**: Mid-frequency (2-8 occurrences) - too common = function word, hapax = unreliable
3. **Length criterion**: 2-5 syllables (typical for Bronze Age Aegean names)
4. **Exclusion criterion**: Not logograms, fractions, or known function words (KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA₂)

### Anchor Level for Name Analysis

| Evidence Type | Anchor Level | Max Confidence |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Position before number | Level 4 (Structural) | MEDIUM |
| Multi-site attestation | Level 4+ | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Morphological pattern (-WA, -JA) | Level 5 | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Linguistic etymology | Level 6 | LOW |

---

## Category 1: High-Confidence Personal Names

Words appearing multiple times before numbers across multiple sites.

### KU-PA₃-NU
**Frequency**: 8 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (7), PH (1)
**Confidence**: PROBABLE (personal name)

| Tablet | Context |
|--------|---------|
| HT1 | KU-PA₃-NU 109 |
| HT3 | KU-PA₃-NU 3 |
| HT49a | KU-PA₃-NU 1 |
| HT88 | KU-PA₃-NU 1 |
| HT117a | KU-PA₃-NU 1 |
| HT122a | KU-PA₃-NU 1 (x2) |
| PH(?)31a | KU-PA₃-NU AU-SI-RE 1 |

**Pattern**: Consistently precedes numbers. Syllable structure (3 syllables) typical for names.
**Variant**: KU-PA₃-RI-JA (HT24a) - same root with -RI-JA ending?

### DA-RE
**Frequency**: 7 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (5), PK (1), KH (1) - MULTI-SITE
**Confidence**: PROBABLE (personal name)

| Tablet | Context |
|--------|---------|
| HT7a | DA-RE 1 |
| HT10a | DA-RE 16 ½ |
| HT10b | DA-RE 2 |
| HT85a | DA-RE 4 |
| HT122b | DA-RE 2 |
| PK3 | DA-RE 72 |
| KH... | (additional) |

**Pattern**: Always followed by numbers. Multi-site distribution suggests mobile individual or common name.

### MA-DI
**Frequency**: 6 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (5), PH (1)
**Periods**: LMIB (5), MMIII (1) - attested across periods
**Confidence**: PROBABLE (personal name)

| Tablet | Context |
|--------|---------|
| HT3 | MA-DI 2 |
| HT69 | MA-DI 4 |
| HT85b | MA-DI 1 |
| HT97a | MA-DI 5 |
| HT118 | MA-DI 15 |
| PH(?)31a | MA-DI *21M 1 |

**Pattern**: Always followed by numbers. Time-depth (MMIII-LMIB) suggests stable naming tradition.

### DI-NA-U
**Frequency**: 6 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (5), KNZ (1) - MULTI-SITE
**Confidence**: PROBABLE (personal name)

**Note**: -U ending. May represent accusative/genitive form of *DI-NA.

---

## Category 2: Probable Personal Names (Single Site, Strong Pattern)

### PA-JA-RE
**Frequency**: 4 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (3), ZA (1) - MULTI-SITE
**Confidence**: PROBABLE

Pattern: PA-JA-RE + NUMBER in all 4 attestations.

### KI-RE-TA-NA
**Frequency**: 4 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (4)
**Confidence**: POSSIBLE (personal name or toponym)

| Tablet | Context |
|--------|---------|
| HT2 | KI-RE-TA-NA OLE+U 54 |
| HT8a | KI-RE-TA-NA ½ |
| HT108 | KI-RE-TA-NA VIR+[?] 1 |
| HT120 | KI-RE-TA-NA GRA+B 60 |

**Note**: 4-syllable structure. May be toponym (place name) rather than personal name given association with commodities.

### PA-SE-JA
**Frequency**: 3 occurrences
**Sites**: HT (1), HTW (2)
**Confidence**: POSSIBLE (personal name)

**Note**: -JA ending suggests possible genitive/possessive (see morphological analysis below).

---

## Category 3: -WA Ending Names (Luwian Pattern)

The ending -WA is significant for Luwian hypothesis testing. In Luwian onomastics, -wa is a common name-forming element.

### Confirmed -WA Names

| Word | Frequency | Sites | Context |
|------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **KO-A-DU-WA** | 1 (hapax) | TY | OLE 7 |
| **A-SU-PU-WA** | 1 (hapax) | ARKH | [number] 4 |
| **DU-PI-TE-WA** | 1 (hapax) | MA | *405+Ω |
| **QA-RA₂-WA** | 1 | HT | 10 |
| **DU-ZU-WA** | 1 | HT | 7 ½ |
| **DA-WA** | 1 | KNZ | (context unclear) |
| **JA-WA** | 1 | KNZ | (context unclear) |
| **I-NA-WA** | 1 | PH | (line break) |

**Analysis**:
- All -WA words are hapax or very low frequency
- Pattern: Most appear before numbers (name + quantity)
- **KO-A-DU-WA** structure: KO-A-DU could be interpreted as compound (Luwian compounds common)

### Luwian Hypothesis Test

**For**: -WA ending matches Luwian onomastic pattern
**Against**: All hapax legomena (max confidence: POSSIBLE)
**Verdict**: SUPPORTS Luwian hypothesis for personal names, but insufficient frequency for PROBABLE rating

---

## Category 4: -JA Ending Names

The -JA ending appears in 65 corpus occurrences across many words. Functions may include:

1. Personal name suffix
2. Genitive/possessive marker
3. Adjectival suffix (cf. Luwian -iya)

### High-Frequency -JA Words (Potential Names)

| Word | Frequency | Sites | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA** | 11 | IOZ, KOZ, PKZ, SYZ, TLZ | Religious term (peak sanctuaries) - NOT personal name |
| **PI-TA-JA** | 1 | HT | + number = possible name |
| **I-RU-JA** | 1 | HT | + number = possible name |
| **A-SU-JA** | 1 | HT | + number = possible name |
| **KU-PA₃-RI-JA** | 1 | HT | Variant of KU-PA₃-NU? |
| **PA-SA-RI-JA** | 1 | HT | + number = possible name |

**Note**: A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA appears exclusively at peak sanctuary sites (IOZ, KOZ, PKZ, SYZ, TLZ) - this is clearly a religious formula, NOT a personal name.

### -WA-JA Compound Ending

13 occurrences of *-WA-JA pattern:
- 11 are A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA (religious)
- 1 is A-NA-TI-*301-WA-JA (religious variant)
- 1 is I-WA-JA (unclear)

**Assessment**: -WA-JA appears religious/formulaic, not onomastic.

---

## Category 5: -NU Ending Names

The -NU ending appears in 22 occurrences.

| Word | Frequency | Assessment |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **KU-PA₃-NU** | 8 | Probable personal name |
| **DE-NU** | 1 | Uncertain |
| **TU-QE-NU** | 1 | Uncertain |
| **DA-MI-NU** | 1 | Possible name |
| **U-TI-NU** | 3 | Element in religious formula |
| **TU-NU** | 1 | Uncertain |
| **PI-NU** | 1 | Uncertain |
| **QE-DE-MI-NU** | 2 | Uncertain |
| **KI-NU** | 1 | Uncertain |

**Pattern**: KU-PA₃-NU is the only well-attested -NU name. Others are hapax or appear in formulaic contexts.

---

## Category 6: -U Ending (Potential Case Marker)

Several potential names end in -U:

| Word | Frequency | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **DI-NA-U** | 6 | Before numbers |
| **QE-RA₂-U** | 3 | Before numbers, also line-initial |
| **A-KA-RU** | 3 | Before OLE (olive oil) - header? |

**Hypothesis**: -U may be nominative or genitive singular marker on personal names, with -NA/-RA₂ being the stem.

## Multi-Hypothesis Analysis of Name Patterns

### Luwian/Anatolian Assessment

| Pattern | Luwian Support | Evidence |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| -WA ending | MODERATE | Matches Luwian onomastic suffix |
| -JA ending | MODERATE | Matches Luwian adjectival -iya |
| KO-A-DU-WA | POSSIBLE | Compound structure (Ko-adu-wa) |
| A-SU-PU-WA | POSSIBLE | Could be Luwian 'aspu-wa |

**Verdict**: Name endings consistent with Luwian, but all -WA names are hapax.

### Semitic Assessment

| Pattern | Semitic Support | Evidence |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| 3-syllable names | NEUTRAL | Common cross-linguistically |
| KU-PA₃-NU | WEAK | No clear Semitic etymology |
| DA-RE | WEAK | No clear Semitic etymology |

**Verdict**: No strong Semitic name patterns identified.

### Pre-Greek Assessment

| Pattern | Pre-Greek Support | Evidence |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| -NA ending | POSSIBLE | Pre-Greek substrate names often end in -na |
| KI-RE-TA-NA | MODERATE | -nthos/-na pattern (cf. Mykenai, Athena) |

**Verdict**: Some names fit Pre-Greek substrate patterns.

### Proto-Greek Assessment

| Pattern | Proto-Greek Support | Evidence |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| PA-JA-RE | WEAK | No clear Greek etymology |
| DI-NA-U | WEAK | Could relate to δῖνος but semantic stretch |

**Verdict**: No strong Greek name patterns identified.

---

## Negative Evidence

### What the Data Does NOT Show

1. **No clear Greek theophoric names** (e.g., no clear equivalents to -doros, -theos)
2. **No Semitic triconsonantal roots** in name structures
3. **Limited inflectional variation** - names appear in fixed form (unlike Greek with case endings)
4. **No obvious patronymics** (X son of Y pattern)

### Absence Implications

- If Minoan were Greek, we would expect theophoric names (common in Linear B)
- If Semitic, we would expect consonantal root patterns
- The limited inflection suggests either:
  - Uninflected naming system
  - Names in single case form only
  - Our sample is too restricted

## High-Confidence Personal Name List

| Name | Frequency | Sites | Confidence | Linguistic Affiliation |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **KU-PA₃-NU** | 8 | HT, PH | PROBABLE | Unknown |
| **DA-RE** | 7 | HT, PK, KH | PROBABLE | Unknown |
| **MA-DI** | 6 | HT, PH | PROBABLE | Unknown |
| **DI-NA-U** | 6 | HT, KNZ | PROBABLE | Unknown |
| **PA-JA-RE** | 4 | HT, ZA | PROBABLE | Unknown |
| **KO-A-DU-WA** | 1 | TY | POSSIBLE | Luwian pattern |
| **A-SU-PU-WA** | 1 | ARKH | POSSIBLE | Luwian pattern |

---

## Findings Summary

### Confirmed Patterns

1. **Name + Number Structure**: Words appearing before numbers in list contexts are likely personal names recording individuals and their allocations/contributions.

2. **Mid-Frequency Distribution**: Personal names cluster in 2-8 occurrence range. Higher frequencies indicate function words; lower frequencies are hapax (unreliable).

3. **Multi-Site Names**: DA-RE, DI-NA-U, PA-JA-RE appear at multiple sites, suggesting either:
   - Common naming tradition across Crete
   - Mobile individuals appearing in multiple archives
   - Administrative standardization

4. **-WA Ending Pattern**: Nine words with -WA ending, all hapax or very low frequency, all appearing before numbers. Consistent with Luwian onomastic pattern but insufficient data for strong confidence.

5. **-JA Ending Dichotomy**: -JA appears in both:
   - Formulaic religious contexts (A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA)
   - Potential personal names (PA-SE-JA, PI-TA-JA)

### Novel Observations

1. **KU-PA₃ Root Family**: KU-PA₃-NU (8x) and KU-PA₃-RI-JA (1x) may represent the same person/name with different endings, suggesting:
   - Case inflection (-NU vs -RI-JA)
   - Derivational relationship

2. **Time Depth**: MA-DI appears in both MMIII (Phaistos) and LMIB (Hagia Triada), spanning ~200 years. This suggests either:
   - Very stable naming tradition
   - Different individuals with same name
   - Long-lived archive preservation

3. **SI-KA as Identifier**: SI-KA appears 6 times, all on HTW sealings alone, suggesting it may be a seal owner's name or institutional marker.

---

## Recommendations for Future Analysis

1. **Prosopographic Study**: Track individual names across tablets to reconstruct social networks.

2. **Commodity Association**: Analyze which names appear with which commodities (specialists?).

3. **Scribe Correlation**: Check if specific names appear only with specific scribes (contemporaneity).

4. **KU-PA₃ Investigation**: Deep analysis of KU-PA₃-NU / KU-PA₃-RI-JA relationship.

5. **SI-KA Sealing Study**: Investigate SI-KA as institutional identifier.
