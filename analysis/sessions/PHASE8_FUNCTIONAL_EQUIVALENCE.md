# Phase 8: Functional Equivalence Matrix

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Phase**: OPERATION MINOS Phase 8 Track C1
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This matrix synthesizes findings from Phase 8 Track A (KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA₂ analysis) and Track B (KH, ZA, PH vocabulary analysis) to answer the critical question: **Do different sites use different terms for the same administrative functions?**

### Key Finding

**The HT administrative vocabulary (KU-RO/KI-RO/SA-RA₂) represents a SPECIALIZED SYSTEM, not a universal Minoan standard.**

| Function | HT Term | KH Equivalent | ZA Equivalent | PH Equivalent |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **TOTAL** | KU-RO | NOT FOUND | KU-RO (1x) | KU-RO (1x) |
| **DEFICIT** | KI-RO | NOT FOUND | KI-RA (1x)? | NOT FOUND |
| **ALLOCATION** | SA-RA₂ | NOT FOUND | NOT FOUND | NOT FOUND |

## 1. Site-by-Site Administrative Function Mapping

### 1.1 Totaling Function

| Site | Term | Count | Verification | Confidence |
|------|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **HT** | KU-RO | 35 | 83% mathematically verified | **CERTAIN** |
| **ZA** | KU-RO | 1 | Structurally verified (VIN 78) | **HIGH** |
| **PH** | KU-RO | 1 | Structurally verified (CAPm+KU) | **HIGH** |
| **KH** | **???** | 0 | No consistent totaling marker found | **UNKNOWN** |

**Conclusion**: KU-RO = "total" is confirmed at HT, ZA, and PH. However, KH (the second-largest corpus) shows NO totaling markers whatsoever.

### 1.2 Deficit Function

| Site | Term | Count | Evidence | Confidence |
|------|------|-------|----------|------------|
| **HT** | KI-RO | 16 | Appears with small/fractional values; co-occurs with KU-RO | **HIGH** |
| **ZA** | KI-RA? | 1 | Header position, uncertain function | **SPECULATIVE** |
| **PH** | NOT FOUND | 0 | — | — |
| **KH** | NOT FOUND | 0 | — | — |

**Conclusion**: KI-RO deficit marking appears EXCLUSIVE to HT. ZA has KI-RA which may be a dialectal variant, but only 1 occurrence prevents verification.

### 1.3 Allocation/Distribution Function

| Site | Term | Count | Context | Confidence |
|------|------|-------|---------|------------|
| **HT** | SA-RA₂ | 20 | Multi-commodity (GRA, CYP, OLE); follows personal names | **PROBABLE** |
| **ZA** | NOT FOUND | 0 | — | — |
| **PH** | NOT FOUND | 0 | — | — |
| **KH** | NOT FOUND | 0 | — | — |

**Conclusion**: SA-RA₂ is **COMPLETELY HT-EXCLUSIVE**. No equivalent found at any other site.

### Administrative Functions

| Function | HT | KH | ZA | PH | Cross-Site? |
|----------|----|----|----|----|-------------|
| TOTAL | KU-RO (35) | — | KU-RO (1) | KU-RO (1) | **PARTIAL** |
| DEFICIT | KI-RO (16) | — | KI-RA? (1) | — | **NO** |
| ALLOCATION | SA-RA₂ (20) | — | — | — | **NO** |
| ASSESSMENT | A-DU (10) | A-DU (2) | — | — | **YES** |
| SUBTOTAL | KU-RE (2) | — | — | — | **NO** |
| GRAND TOTAL | PO-TO-KU-RO (~10) | — | — | — | **NO** |

### Commodity Logograms (Shared)

| Logogram | Meaning | HT | KH | ZA | PH | Universal? |
|----------|---------|----|----|----|----|------------|
| GRA | grain | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **YES** |
| VIN | wine | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **YES** |
| OLE | olive oil | ✓ | Low | Low | ✓ | **YES** |
| CYP | cyperus | ✓ | **DOMINANT** | ✓ | Low | **YES** |
| NI | figs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **YES** |
| *21M/*21F | sheep/goat | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | **YES** |

**Note**: Commodity logograms are shared across all sites. Only the **syllabic administrative vocabulary** shows site-specific patterns.

## 3. Khania: The Missing Administrative Vocabulary

### The KH Anomaly

Khania has **227 inscriptions** (13% of corpus) but:
- 0 occurrences of KU-RO
- 0 occurrences of KI-RO
- 0 occurrences of SA-RA₂

### Candidate Replacement Terms at KH

Based on frequency and position analysis:

| KH Term | Count | Position | Possible Function |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| A-DU | 2-3 | Header | Assessment (shared with HT) |
| SI | 12+ | Various | Unknown qualifier |
| RA | 6+ | Pre-commodity | Unknown qualifier |
| NE | 4+ | Various | Unknown qualifier |

**No term at KH fills the "list-end total" position.**

### Hypotheses for KH Absence

1. **Different Administrative System**: KH used a functionally different accounting method that didn't require explicit totaling
2. **Preservation Bias**: KH tablets are more fragmentary, losing final totaling lines
3. **Oral/External Totaling**: Totals were calculated externally (e.g., on perishable materials)
4. **Transaction Type**: KH tablets record different transaction types (e.g., receipts vs. ledgers)

**Most Likely**: Combination of (1) and (4). KH specializes in CYP (cyperus/copper) transactions that may have different recording conventions.

## 4. Regional K-R Paradigm Variants

### K-R Forms by Site

| Form | HT | KH | ZA | PH | Other | Total |
|------|----|----|----|----|-------|-------|
| KU-RO | 35 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 37 |
| KI-RO | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 |
| KU-RA | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 (ARKH) | 2 |
| KI-RA | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| KU-RE | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| KA-RU | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| KI-RU | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 (MIZ) | 1 |

### Interpretation

- **KU-RO** (total): Universal term, attested at HT, ZA, PH
- **KI-RO** (deficit): HT-exclusive, specialized accounting term
- **KU-RA/KI-RA**: May be regional variants at eastern sites (ZA, ARKH)
- **KU-RE**: Possible "subtotal" at HT only

## 5. Vocabulary Overlap Analysis

### Jaccard Similarity Index (Syllabic Words)

| Site Pair | Shared Words | Union | Jaccard Index |
|-----------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| HT - KH | 12 | 680 | **0.018** (1.8%) |
| HT - ZA | 8 | 350 | **0.023** (2.3%) |
| HT - PH | 5 | 420 | **0.012** (1.2%) |
| KH - ZA | 3 | 320 | **0.009** (0.9%) |
| KH - PH | 2 | 300 | **0.007** (0.7%) |
| ZA - PH | 3 | 250 | **0.012** (1.2%) |

### Interpretation

**Extremely low vocabulary overlap** (all < 3%) indicates:
1. Regional administrative independence
2. Different scribal training traditions
3. Possible dialectal variation
4. Site-specific commodity focus affecting vocabulary

## 6. Synthesis: Administrative Function Coverage

### Coverage Matrix

| Function | Required for Admin? | HT Coverage | Cross-Site Coverage |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Total/Sum | Yes | **KU-RO** (HIGH) | PARTIAL (ZA, PH only) |
| Deficit | Optional | **KI-RO** (HIGH) | NO |
| Allocation | Optional | **SA-RA₂** (PROBABLE) | NO |
| Header/Category | Yes | **A-DU** | PARTIAL (KH has A-DU) |
| Personnel | Yes | **VIR+[X]** | YES (universal) |
| Commodities | Yes | **GRA/VIN/OLE/CYP** | YES (universal) |
| Numerals | Yes | Standard system | YES (universal) |

### Key Conclusions

1. **UNIVERSAL**: Numerals, commodity logograms, personnel markers
2. **PARTIAL**: KU-RO totaling term (3/4 major sites)
3. **HT-EXCLUSIVE**: KI-RO, SA-RA₂, PO-TO-KU-RO, KU-RE

## 7. Implications for Linear A Decipherment

### For KU-RO = "total" (*kull)

**STRENGTHENED**: The Semitic *kull* hypothesis is supported by:
- Universal totaling function at HT, ZA, PH
- Mathematical verification (83% at HT)
- Position consistency (list-final)

**QUALIFIED**: Must note that KU-RO is absent at KH (2nd largest corpus)

### For KI-RO = "deficit"

**UNCERTAIN**: The reading is well-supported at HT but:
- 0 non-HT occurrences prevents universality claim
- May be HT-specific administrative innovation
- Could be related to centralized accounting at HT

### For SA-RA₂ = "allocation"

**LOCALIZED**: The Akkadian *šarāku* hypothesis remains:
- Supported by HT evidence
- Unverifiable cross-site (no other attestations)
- Should be noted as "HT administrative vocabulary" not "Minoan universal"

## 8. First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| P1 (Kober) | PASS | Functional analysis before language assumptions |
| P2 (Ventris) | PASS | HT-centricity acknowledged; no forced universality |
| P3 (Anchors) | PASS | Built from KU-RO mathematical verification |
| P4 (Multi-Hyp) | PASS | Regional variation as alternative to Semitic uniformity |
| P5 (Negative) | **CRITICAL** | KH absence is central finding |
| P6 (Corpus) | PASS | All major sites analyzed |

## 9. Recommendations

### Update CONFIRMED_READINGS.md

Add regional qualifications:
- KU-RO: "total" — HIGH confidence, **verified at HT/ZA/PH; absent at KH**
- KI-RO: "deficit" — HIGH confidence, **HT-EXCLUSIVE**
- SA-RA₂: "allocation" — PROBABLE confidence, **HT-EXCLUSIVE**

### Future Research

1. **KH Deep Dive**: Analyze KH position patterns to identify any totaling mechanism
2. **K-RA Forms**: Investigate if KU-RA/KI-RA are dialectal variants
3. **Chronological**: Track vocabulary changes MMII → MMIII → LMIB
