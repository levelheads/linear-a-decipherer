# Chronological Vocabulary Analysis: Linear A c.1800-1450 BCE

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Type**: Diachronic Corpus Analysis
**Scope**: Vocabulary evolution across MMII, MMIII, LMIA, LMIB periods

---

## Executive Summary

Linear A vocabulary shows **significant chronological stratification**. Administrative terminology (KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA2) is **concentrated in LMIB** (c.1450 BCE, destroyed by volcanic eruption), while earlier periods show distinct lexical profiles. Only **2 terms** (TE, NA) appear continuously across all four periods.

Key findings:
1. KU-RO and KI-RO are **almost exclusively LMIB** phenomena
2. Religious vocabulary (libation formulas) concentrates in **LMIA-LMIB**
3. Commodity logograms (VIN) show **earliest attestation** in MMII
4. Vocabulary overlap between periods is **surprisingly low** (Jaccard similarity 0.012-0.054)

## Corpus Distribution by Period

| Period | Inscriptions | Word Tokens | Unique Words | Primary Sites |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| MMII   | 27          | 40          | 32           | Phaistos (PH) |
| MMIII  | 65          | 163         | 125          | Phaistos, Malia (MA) |
| LMIA   | 55          | 137         | 109          | Peak sanctuaries |
| LMIB   | 1,542       | 3,597       | 1,091        | Hagia Triada (HT), Khania |

**Critical Observation**: The corpus is heavily skewed toward LMIB. This is not sampling bias but preservation bias - LMIB archives were sealed by the Thera eruption/destruction, preserving them intact.

## Question 1: Do KU-RO and KI-RO Appear in All Periods?

### KU-RO ("total"?)

| Period | Occurrences |
|--------|-------------|
| MMII   | 0           |
| MMIII  | 1           |
| LMIA   | 0           |
| LMIB   | 33          |

**Analysis**: KU-RO is **functionally a LMIB term**. The single MMIII occurrence (PH(?)31a from Phaistos) reads:

```
... KU-RO CAPm+KU 1 | *21M 5 | *21F 3
```

This appears in an animal-counting context, supporting the "total" interpretation. However, KU-RO is absent from LMIA entirely despite 55 inscriptions in that period.

**Interpretation**: Either:
- (a) KU-RO terminology was innovated late (LMIB standardization), or
- (b) LMIA inscriptions are functionally different (more religious, less administrative)

### KI-RO ("deficit/owed"?)

| Period | Occurrences |
|--------|-------------|
| MMII   | 0           |
| MMIII  | 0           |
| LMIA   | 0           |
| LMIB   | 12          |

**Analysis**: KI-RO is **exclusively LMIB**. It appears only at Hagia Triada in administrative contexts. If KI-RO marks deficits/debts, this practice was either:
- Innovated in LMIB period, or
- Used differently in earlier periods (without the KI-RO marker), or
- Coincidentally absent from our earlier sample

### SA-RA2 ("contribution/allocation"?)

| Period | Occurrences |
|--------|-------------|
| MMII   | 0           |
| MMIII  | 0           |
| LMIA   | 0           |
| LMIB   | 20          |

**Analysis**: SA-RA2 is also **exclusively LMIB**, always at Hagia Triada. Like KI-RO, this suggests LMIB administrative standardization.

## Question 2: Vocabulary Unique to Early Periods (MMII, MMIII)

### MMII Exclusive Terms (17 terms)

Terms found ONLY in MMII (c.1800-1700 BCE):

```
KA-*314-SI, E-TA2-QE, TI-TI-MA, I-ZU-RI-NI-TA, *314, *314-TA-MA,
*328-E, MA-RE-RI-MI-DE, I-NA-WA, PI-O, RO-E, I-DA-PA3-I-SA-RI, JA-DI,
*320, *355-E-*354
```

**Observations**:
- Many use signs (*314, *320, *328, *355, *354) that are rare or absent later
- Long compounds (I-DA-PA3-I-SA-RI, MA-RE-RI-MI-DE) suggest personal names or titles
- Some may be archaic vocabulary lost by LMIB

### MMIII Exclusive Terms (85 terms)

Sample of terms found ONLY in MMIII (c.1700-1600 BCE):

```
HIDE+B, A-SE-TU-*21F, DI-RA-DI-NA, DU-RI, *412+E, JA-SI-E, *659,
*414+F, RI-RU-MA-TI, *357, *356, JA-RU-MA-NE, *358-NI, *811, *556,
DI-PA-JA, A-MI, *360, DU-RA, *328, TE-ZU, PA-TA-DA, DU-PI-TE-WA
```

**Observations**:
- High concentration of HIDE logograms (animal husbandry focus at Malia)
- Many unique sign numbers (*356, *357, *358, etc.) - archaic or local variants?
- Names like JA-RU-MA-NE, RI-RU-MA-TI show reduplication patterns

### Implications

The early periods show:
1. **Different sign inventory** - many signs become obsolete by LMIB
2. **Different economic focus** - more HIDE logograms in MMIII
3. **Possible dialectal differences** - Phaistos/Malia vs. Hagia Triada vocabulary

---

## Question 3: Vocabulary Unique to Late Periods (LMIA, LMIB)

### LMIA Exclusive Terms (66 terms)

Sample of terms found ONLY in LMIA (c.1600-1500 BCE):

```
JA-DI-KI-TU, QA-SA-RA-KU, SE-KA-NA-SI, SE-TO-I-JA, A-TA-NA-JE, KI-NU,
DA-WA, PI-TI-NE-A, A-JE, KA-NE, I-NA-TA-I-ZU-DI-SI-KA, A-SA-SA-*802-ME,
A-RE-NE-SI-DI-*301-PI-KE-PA-JA-TA-RI-SE-TE-RI-MU-A-JA-KU (very long!),
A-SU-MI-*118, A-RE-SA-NA, TA-NA-SU-TE-KE, TA-NA-I-*301-U-TI-NU
```

**Observations**:
- Long formulaic sequences (libation formula variants)
- Religious/dedicatory vocabulary dominates
- Names with theophoric elements (-KU, -TE endings)

### LMIB Exclusive Terms (1,013 terms)

Sample (showing standardized administrative vocabulary):

```
KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA2, PO-TO-KU-RO, DA-ME, TE-KI, *401+*304, *322,
GRA+BOSm, VAS, DA+RE+SE, VINb+WI, *309C-DA-JU
```

**Observations**:
- Specialized accounting terminology appears
- Commodity ligatured forms (GRA+BOSm, VINb+WI) - advanced notation
- Transaction markers (DA-ME "issue"?)

## Question 4: Administrative Standardization Over Time

### Evidence for LMIB Standardization

| Metric | MMII | MMIII | LMIA | LMIB |
|--------|------|-------|------|------|
| Avg syllables/word | 1.89 | 1.75 | 2.79 | 1.67 |
| KU-RO usage | 0 | 1 | 0 | 33 |
| Commodity logogram varieties | VIN only | VIN, GRA | VIN, GRA, OLE | 6+ types |
| Transaction markers | 0 | 0 | 0 | Multiple |

### Top Terms by Period (Showing Functional Shift)

**MMII Top Terms**:
```
VIN (5), TE (3), A-RI (2), TI (2)
```
Simple commodity notation, minimal administrative apparatus.

**MMIII Top Terms**:
```
HIDE+[?] (7), TI (4), *21M (4), NI (3), *412+E (3)
```
Animal counting focus, ideographic emphasis.

**LMIA Top Terms**:
```
A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA (5), SI-RU-TE (4), OLE (4), GRA (4), JA-SA-SA-RA-ME (3)
```
Religious formulas dominate, commodities secondary.

**LMIB Top Terms**:
```
*301 (238), KU (169), KA (168), SI (115), RO (93), GRA (58), KU-RO (36)
```
Phonetic signs dominate, clear administrative systematization.

### Interpretation

LMIB shows **advanced administrative standardization**:
1. Consistent use of KU-RO totaling marker
2. Standardized transaction vocabulary (KI-RO, SA-RA2, DA-ME)
3. Higher word frequency concentration (fewer unique terms used more often)
4. Ligatured commodity symbols for efficiency

Earlier periods show:
1. More idiosyncratic vocabulary
2. Regionally variable practices (Phaistos vs. Malia)
3. Less standardized accounting formulas

## Vocabulary Persistence Analysis

### Terms Surviving from MMII to Later Periods

MMII vocabulary (29 terms) survival:

| Period | Terms Surviving | Examples |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| MMIII  | 6 (21%)         | TE, NA, TI, JA-SA, HIDE+[?] |
| LMIA   | 4 (14%)         | TE, NA, VIN, JA-SA |
| LMIB   | 9 (31%)         | TE, NA, VIN, TI, RO, A-RI, QI, SA-RA, *301+*311 |

**Core Vocabulary** (found in all four periods): **TE, NA**

These are likely function words or very common syllables, not content vocabulary.

### Jaccard Similarity (Vocabulary Overlap)

| Comparison | Jaccard | Shared | Unique P1 | Unique P2 |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| MMII-MMIII | 0.054   | 8      | 24        | 117       |
| MMII-LMIA  | 0.044   | 6      | 26        | 103       |
| MMII-LMIB  | 0.012   | 13     | 19        | 1078      |
| MMIII-LMIA | 0.035   | 8      | 117       | 101       |
| MMIII-LMIB | 0.033   | 39     | 86        | 1052      |
| LMIA-LMIB  | 0.035   | 41     | 68        | 1050      |

**Critical Finding**: Vocabulary overlap is **extremely low** across periods. Even adjacent periods (MMIII-LMIA) share only ~3.5% of vocabulary.

Possible explanations:
1. **Functional differentiation** - different text types in different periods
2. **Scribal variation** - different scribal traditions
3. **Language change** - vocabulary evolution over 350 years
4. **Sampling effects** - small corpus sizes in early periods

## Religious vs. Administrative Vocabulary Chronology

### Religious Terms (Libation Formulas)

| Term | MMII | MMIII | LMIA | LMIB |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| JA-SA-SA-RA-ME | 0 | 0 | 3 | 4 |
| A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA | 0 | 0 | 5 | 3 |
| I-DA-MA-TE | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| A-DI-KI-TE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**Observation**: Religious formulae are **LMIA-LMIB phenomena** in the corpus. Peak sanctuary dedications concentrated in Late Minoan periods.

### Administrative Terms

| Term | MMII | MMIII | LMIA | LMIB |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| KU-RO | 0 | 1 | 0 | 33 |
| KI-RO | 0 | 0 | 0 | 12 |
| SA-RA2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 20 |
| DA-ME | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 |

**Observation**: Standardized administrative terminology is **exclusively or predominantly LMIB**.

---

## Conclusions

### 1. KU-RO and KI-RO Distribution
- **KU-RO**: Essentially LMIB (33/34 = 97%), one MMIII precursor at Phaistos
- **KI-RO**: Exclusively LMIB (12/12 = 100%)
- Both terms are **LMIB administrative innovations** or represent standardization of earlier variable practices

### 2. Early Period Exclusive Vocabulary
- MMII: 17 exclusive terms, many with archaic sign numbers (*314, *320, *355)
- MMIII: 85 exclusive terms, focus on animal husbandry (HIDE logograms)
- These may represent:
  - Archaic vocabulary lost by LMIB
  - Regional variants (Phaistos, Malia) not used at Hagia Triada
  - Functional vocabulary types not preserved in LMIB archives

### 3. Late Period Exclusive Vocabulary
- LMIA: 66 exclusive terms, predominantly religious formulas
- LMIB: 1,013 exclusive terms, standardized administrative vocabulary
- This reflects:
  - Functional specialization of preserved texts
  - Possible vocabulary innovation/borrowing
  - Administrative systematization at Hagia Triada

### 4. Administrative Standardization
Strong evidence for **increasing standardization** toward LMIB:
- Shorter average word length in LMIB (1.67 syllables)
- Consistent use of totaling markers (KU-RO)
- Standardized transaction vocabulary
- Higher frequency concentration of common terms

## Methodological Notes

### Limitations
1. **Corpus bias**: LMIB dominates (89% of inscriptions)
2. **Functional bias**: LMIA = religious, LMIB = administrative
3. **Geographic bias**: LMIB = primarily Hagia Triada
4. **Preservation bias**: Thera eruption sealed LMIB archives

### Confidence Assessment
- Period distribution data: HIGH (based on archaeological dating)
- Vocabulary analysis: MEDIUM-HIGH (limited by corpus size in early periods)
- Standardization hypothesis: PROBABLE (pattern consistent but confounded by sampling)
- Language change hypothesis: POSSIBLE (cannot distinguish from functional differentiation)

## First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [1] KOBER | PASS | Analysis driven by distributional patterns, not language assumptions |
| [2] VENTRIS | PASS | Limitations acknowledged; alternative explanations considered |
| [3] ANCHORS | PASS | Built from established chronology, logograms, then vocabulary |

## Implications for Decipherment

1. **KU-RO/KI-RO readings should be tested on LMIB material first** - that is where they appear
2. **MMII vocabulary may preserve archaic forms** - useful for etymological analysis
3. **LMIA material is primarily religious** - different interpretation strategies needed
4. **Vocabulary discontinuity is high** - caution warranted in assuming semantic continuity across periods
