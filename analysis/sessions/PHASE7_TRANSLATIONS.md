**Notable Features**:
- Uses many of the same names as HT 9a (PA-DE, *306-TU, DI-NA-U, QE-PU, *324-DI-RA, TA-I-AROM)
- Different quantities assigned to same names
- Different heading (PA3, WA-JA-PI, KA-*305)

| TA-I-AROM | 2.5 | 2 | -0.5 |
| A-RU (9a only) | 4.25 | - | - |
| A-SI (9b only) | - | 3 | - |

**Interpretation**: These may represent:
- Different time periods for the same recipients
- Different commodity types (9a = wine; 9b = unspecified)
- Different allocation categories
- Owed vs. received amounts

- VIR+KA = ligature of "person" + KA (qualifier?)
- Contains both NI (figs logogram) and personnel entries
- Uses KI-RO (deficit/owed marker)
- Two-section document

### Translation Attempt

KU-RO         TOTAL - 6                            (HIGH)
```

### Numerical Analysis

**Section 1 (Before KI-RO)**:
- VIR+KA 20 - Assessment of 20 men?
- RE-ZA 6 - 6 from RE-ZA?
- NI KI-KI-NA 7 - 7 [units of] figs?

**Section 2 (After KI-RO - "Deficit")**:
- 6 individuals listed, each with quantity 1
- KU-RO 6 = total of deficit section

### Interpretive Translation (Speculative)

> **Personnel/Commodity Assessment (A-DU)**
>
> Men (qualified): 20 [assessed/required]
> RE-ZA: 6
> Figs - KI-KI-NA type: 7
>
> **Deficit/Outstanding (KI-RO)**:
> - KU-PA3-PA3: 1 [unit owed]
> - KA-JU: 1 [unit owed]
> - KU-PA3-NU: 1 [unit owed]
> - PA-JA-RE: 1 [unit owed]
> - SA-MA-RO: 1 [unit owed]
> - DA-TA-RE: 1 [unit owed]
> **Total Outstanding: 6**

### Multi-Hypothesis Analysis of A-DU

| Hypothesis | Proposed Etymology | Evidence | Rating |
|------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| **Semitic** | Akkadian *adu* "assessment, inspection" | Administrative context; -U ending | PROBABLE |
| **Luwian** | Unknown | No clear parallel | WEAK |
| **Pre-Greek** | Substrate term | Position as document heading | POSSIBLE |
| **Proto-Greek** | No cognate | No morphological match | WEAK |

### Confidence Assessment

| Element | Interpretation | Confidence |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| A-DU = administrative term | Document heading | PROBABLE |
| VIR+KA = personnel | Logogram | HIGH |
| NI = figs | Logogram | HIGH |
| KI-RO = deficit section | Structural marker | HIGH |
| KU-RO = total | Sum of deficit section | HIGH |
| Names = 6 individuals | Personnel list | PROBABLE |

**Overall Translation Confidence**: PROBABLE (good structural understanding; key terms identified)

## Synthesis: What We Can Read

### Fully Understood Elements

| Category | Elements | Confidence |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Commodity logograms** | VIN (wine), NI (figs), OLE (oil), GRA (grain), VIR (person) | HIGH-CERTAIN |
| **Numerical system** | Base-10; fractions (1/2, 1/4, 3/4); verified by mathematical sums | CERTAIN |
| **Totaling term** | KU-RO = total/sum (37 attestations; 100% list-final position) | HIGH |
| **Deficit term** | KI-RO = deficit/owed (16 attestations) | HIGH |
| **Transaction marker** | TE (appears between heading and body) | PROBABLE |
| **Document structure** | Header + entries + total | HIGH |

### Partially Understood Elements

| Category | Elements | Confidence | Issue |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Heading terms** | SA-RO, KA-U-DE-TA, PA3 | POSSIBLE | Function clear, meaning unknown |
| **Administrative terms** | A-DU, SA-RA2 | PROBABLE | Semitic etymologies proposed |
| **Personal names** | 20+ distinct sequences | POSSIBLE | Cannot confirm anthroponymic status |

### What Remains Unknown

1. **Language identification**: No definitive genetic affiliation
2. **Verbal morphology**: No clear verb forms identified
3. **Case system**: Endings unclear (-U, -A, -I, -E patterns noted)
4. **Personal names vs. titles**: Cannot distinguish with certainty
5. **Commodity units**: Standard measure unknown (liters? kilograms?)

## First Principles Verification

### [1] KOBER: Data-Led Analysis?
**PASS**: Started with transliterations and positional patterns before interpretations.

### [2] VENTRIS: Evidence Not Forced?
**PASS**: Acknowledged numerical discrepancies rather than explaining them away.

### [3] ANCHORS: Built from Confirmed Outward?
**PASS**: Used confirmed logograms and KU-RO as foundation for interpretations.
- Anchors used: VIN, NI, VIR, KU-RO, KI-RO, TE

### [4] MULTI-HYP: All Four Hypotheses Tested?
**PARTIAL**: Tested Semitic, Luwian, Pre-Greek, Proto-Greek for key terms (A-DU, SA-RO).
- Note: Full multi-hypothesis testing would require more extensive analysis.

### [5] NEGATIVE: Absence Considered?
**PASS**: Noted absence of:
- Clear verbal morphology
- Definitive language markers
- Case ending patterns

### [6] CORPUS: Readings Verified Across Corpus?
**PASS**: KU-RO verified across 37 attestations; KI-RO across 16.

## Conclusions

### Translation Viability

| Tablet | Overall Confidence | Key Insight |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| HT 13 | PROBABLE | Wine distribution to 6 recipients; totaling verified |
| HT 9a | PROBABLE | Wine list with 7 recipients; related to HT 9b |
| HT 9b | PROBABLE | Same recipients, different quantities; exact sum verified |
| HT 88 | PROBABLE | Two-section document: assessment + deficit |

### What Phase 7 Demonstrates

1. **Administrative texts are readable**: Basic structure, commodities, and numerals are clear
2. **Mathematical verification works**: KU-RO totals can be verified against entry sums
3. **Cross-referencing tablets is productive**: HT 9a/9b share personnel/recipients
4. **Semitic administrative vocabulary hypothesis gains support**: A-DU, KU-RO patterns
5. **Personal names remain opaque**: Cannot translate individual names

### Recommendations for Phase 8

1. **Expand translation corpus**: Apply method to more HT tablets with clear structure
2. **Name frequency analysis**: Which "names" recur across multiple tablets?
3. **Commodity unit standardization**: What quantities suggest standard measures?
4. **Scribal hand comparison**: Do different scribes use consistent terminology?
5. **Cross-site verification**: Do KH/ZA tablets show same structural patterns?
