# PHASE 8 Track A3: SA-RA2 Contextual Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Objective**: Analyze SA-RA2 contexts and find equivalents at non-HT sites
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis investigates SA-RA2 (20 occurrences, 100% at Hagia Triada) and the broader S-R paradigm to understand:
1. What contexts SA-RA2 appears in
2. Functional relationships within the S-R paradigm
3. Whether functional equivalents exist at other sites (KH, ZA, PH)

**Key Findings**:
- SA-RA2 is an **allocation marker** appearing before COMMODITY + NUMERAL (18/20 = 90%)
- The S-R paradigm contains **9 members** but they show **functional divergence**, not coherent paradigm
- SA-RA2 is **100% HT-exclusive** but S-R variants appear at 4 sites (HT, PKZ, ZA, SAMW)
- **No direct functional equivalent** found at KH for SA-RA2's allocation function
- A-DU appears at both HT and KH in pre-logogram position - potential candidate for broader distribution

## 1. SA-RA2 Occurrence Analysis

### 1.1 Complete Attestations (20 occurrences)

All occurrences at Hagia Triada (HT), LMIB period:

| Tablet | Line | Context Before | SA-RA2 | Following | Numeral |
|--------|------|----------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| HT18 | 4 | 3 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 10 |
| HT28a | 7 | 𐝉 | SA-RA2 | OLE+DI | 1 |
| HT28b | 2 | 𐄁 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 20 |
| HT30 | 2 | SI 4 | SA-RA2 | CYP | - |
| HT32 | 2 | *307 | SA-RA2 | 𐄁 *308 | - |
| HT33 | 1 | (line start) | SA-RA2 | 𐄁 *401+*304 | - |
| HT34 | 2 | 𐄁 | SA-RA2 | 𐄁 MI+JA+KA | - |
| HT90 | 2 | I-KU-RI-NA | SA-RA2 | GRA | 20 |
| HT93a | 5 | 3/4 | SA-RA2 | 20 | 20 |
| HT94a | 7 | KU-RO 110 | SA-RA2 | CYP | 5 |
| HT97b | 1 | (fragment) | SA-RA2 | - | - |
| HT99a | 2 | 𐄁 | SA-RA2 | CYP | 4 |
| HT100 | 8 | KU-RO 97 | SA-RA2 | CYP | 5 |
| HT101 | 5 | OLE 2 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 41 |
| HT102 | 2 | KA-PA | SA-RA2 | GRA | 976 |
| HT105 | 4 | VIR+[?] 234 | SA-RA2 | 𐄁 VIR+[?] | 235 |
| HT114a | 2 | KI-RI-TA2 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 10 |
| HT121 | 2 | OLE 10 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 5 |
| HT125a | 6 | 1/2 | SA-RA2 | GRA | 2 |
| HT130 | 3 | SI 3 | SA-RA2 | CYP | - |

### 1.2 Context Classification

| Context Type | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Before COMMODITY + NUMERAL | 18 | 90% |
| Fragmentary/unclear | 2 | 10% |

### 1.3 Commodity Distribution After SA-RA2

| Commodity | Count | Percentage |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| GRA (grain) | 9 | 45% |
| CYP (cyperus/copper) | 5 | 25% |
| OLE (oil) variants | 1 | 5% |
| VIR+[?] (personnel) | 1 | 5% |
| Unknown logograms | 4 | 20% |

**Critical Observation**: SA-RA2 appears with MULTIPLE commodity types, not just grain. This eliminates any interpretation of SA-RA2 as a commodity name (like "barley"). It must be a **transaction category marker**.

### 1.4 What Precedes SA-RA2

| Preceding Element | Count | Examples |
|-------------------|-------|----------|
| KU-RO (total) + number | 2 | HT94a, HT100 |
| Personal name | 4 | HT90 (I-KU-RI-NA), HT102 (KA-PA), HT114a (KI-RI-TA2) |
| Previous commodity entry | 4 | HT18, HT28a, HT101, HT121, HT125a |
| SI + number | 2 | HT30, HT130 |
| Fraction/number | 2 | HT93a |
| Separator (𐄁) | 3 | HT28b, HT34, HT99a |
| Fragmentary | 3 | HT32, HT33, HT97b |

**Pattern**: SA-RA2 often follows totals (KU-RO) or personal names, introducing a new allocation section.

## 2. S-R Paradigm Analysis

### 2.1 Complete S-R Paradigm Membership

From discovered_paradigms.json (P-SR-9):

| Form | Frequency | Sites | Primary Context |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| SA-RA2 | 20 | HT | administrative (pre-logogram) |
| SA-RU | 6 | HT | counted (pre-numeral) |
| SA-RO | 4 | HT | mixed |
| SA-RA | 2 | HT, SAMW | other (before TE) |
| SI-RU | 2 | HT, **PKZ** | counted/other |
| SU-RE | 1 | HT | counted |
| SI-RA | 1 | HT | counted |
| SI+SE-RA+KA | 1 | HTW | other |
| SA-RI | 1 | **ZA** | other |

**Total occurrences**: 38

### 2.2 Vowel Alternation Patterns

**First syllable alternation (S-vowel)**:
- SA- forms: 33 occurrences (87%)
- SI- forms: 4 occurrences (10.5%)
- SU- forms: 1 occurrence (2.5%)

**Second syllable alternation (-R-vowel)**:
- -RA/-RA2: 24 occurrences (63%)
- -RU: 8 occurrences (21%)
- -RO: 4 occurrences (10.5%)
- -RE: 1 occurrence (2.5%)
- -RI: 1 occurrence (2.5%)

### 2.3 Functional Differentiation

| Form | Dominant Function | Evidence |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| SA-RA2 | ALLOCATION marker | 100% pre-logogram with commodities |
| SA-RU | Transaction marker? | 5/6 before plain numerals, 1/6 before OLIV |
| SA-RO | Mixed | 1 before TE, 2 before numerals, 1 before commodity |
| SA-RA | TE-marker context | Both occurrences before TE |
| SI-RU | Personal name? | Mixed contexts |
| SA-RI | Unknown | Fragmentary (hapax at ZA) |

**Conclusion**: The S-R forms do NOT show coherent paradigmatic behavior like K-R (KU-RO/KI-RO). SA-RA2 stands alone as a distinct allocation marker.

## 3. S-R Variants at Non-HT Sites

### 3.1 Site Distribution Summary

| Form | HT | PKZ | ZA | SAMW | Total |
|------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| SA-RA2 | 20 | - | - | - | 20 |
| SA-RU | 6 | - | - | - | 6 |
| SA-RO | 4 | - | - | - | 4 |
| SI-RU | 1 | **1** | - | - | 2 |
| SA-RA | 1 | - | - | **1** | 2 |
| SA-RI | - | - | **1** | - | 1 |
| Others | 3 | - | - | - | 3 |

### 3.2 Non-HT Occurrences (Detailed)

**SI-RU at Palaikastro (PKZa11)**:
```
Context: I-PI-NA-MI-NA [SI-RU] 𐄁 𐝫
```
- Appears after personal name I-PI-NA-MI-NA
- No following commodity/numeral (fragmentary)
- Different functional context than HT SI-RU

**SA-RI at Zakros (ZA21b)**:
```
Context: 2 | [SA-RI] | 𐝫
```
- Follows numeral
- Fragmentary, no following content
- Only S-R form at Zakros

**SA-RA at Samothrace (SAMWa1)**:
```
Context: JA-SA [SA-RA] TE 10
```
- In compound JA-SA SA-RA
- Before TE marker
- Much earlier period (MMII vs. LMIB at HT)

### 3.3 Analysis: Why No SA-RA2 Outside HT?

**Possible explanations**:

1. **HT-specific scribal practice**: SA-RA2 was terminology unique to HT's administrative system
2. **Document type bias**: SA-RA2 appears in allocation documents; HT may have preserved more of these
3. **Functional specialization**: HT was a redistribution center requiring specific allocation terminology
4. **Chronological factor**: SA-RA2 may be later development (all at LMIB)
5. **Related forms exist**: SI-RU, SA-RI, SA-RA at other sites may be dialectal variants

---

## 4. Search for Functional Equivalents at Non-HT Sites

### 4.1 Methodology

If SA-RA2 = "allocation marker" at HT, what terms perform this function at KH, ZA, PH?

**Criteria for functional equivalent**:
- Appears before commodity logogram + numeral
- Follows personal names or totals
- Administrative (not religious) context

### 4.2 Khania (KH) Analysis

**KH has 99 tablets but ZERO SA-RA2 occurrences**.

**Terms appearing before commodities at KH** (from corpus inspection):
- Personal names directly before commodities (WI-SA-SA-NE CYP 2 in KH5)
- A-KI-PI-E-TE GRA 90 (KH10)
- Various names + commodity patterns

**A-DU at Khania** (potential candidate):
```
KH11: [A-DU] 𐄁 ZA
KH23: [A-DU] | CYP
```
- A-DU appears at both HT and KH
- 10 total occurrences: HT(7), KH(2), TY(1)
- Pre-logogram context in 5/10 cases
- BUT: Not consistently before commodity+numeral like SA-RA2

### 4.3 Zakros (ZA) Analysis

**Terms at ZA in potential allocation position**:
- SA-RI (1 occurrence) - may be variant
- SA-MA (1 occurrence) - followed by numeral
- No clear SA-RA2 equivalent

### 4.4 Phaistos (PH) Analysis

**No S-R forms at Phaistos**.

Possible factors:
- Earliest Linear A period (MMIII)
- Different administrative vocabulary
- Smaller corpus

### 4.5 Conclusion on Equivalents

**No direct functional equivalent found** for SA-RA2 at non-HT sites.

**Possibilities**:
1. Other sites used different allocation terminology (not yet identified)
2. Other sites didn't record allocations in the same way
3. KH tablets are different document types (transaction records vs. allocation summaries)
4. The function was expressed differently (e.g., word order, implied from context)

---

## 5. Does SA-RA2 Govern Multiple Commodities?

### 5.1 Evidence of Multi-Commodity Allocation

**Yes** - SA-RA2 appears with at least 4 different commodity types:

| Commodity | Example Tablets |
|-----------|-----------------|
| GRA (grain) | HT18, HT28b, HT90, HT101, HT102, HT114a, HT121, HT125a |
| CYP (cyperus/copper) | HT30, HT94a, HT99a, HT100, HT130 |
| OLE (oil) | HT28a (OLE+DI) |
| VIR+[?] (personnel?) | HT105 |

### 5.2 Implications

**SA-RA2 is NOT a commodity-specific term**.

This strongly supports the interpretation as a **transaction category marker** meaning "allocation of" or "portion allocated" - applicable to any commodity type.

**Comparison with KU-RO**:
- KU-RO ("total") also appears with multiple commodity types
- Both are transaction/accounting markers, not commodity names

---

## 6. Relationship Between S-R Paradigm Members

### 6.1 Functional Mapping

From discovered_paradigms.json:

| Form | Assigned Function |
|------|-------------------|
| SA-RA2 | administrative |
| SA-RU | counted |
| SA-RO | counted |
| SI-RU | counted |
| SA-RA | other |
| SU-RE | counted |
| SI-RA | counted |
| SI+SE-RA+KA | other |
| SA-RI | other |

### 6.2 Hypothesis: Vowel Alternation = Function?

**Testing K-R paradigm model**:
- K-R shows: KU-RO = "total", KI-RO = "deficit" (U/I alternation)
- S-R shows: SA-RA2 = "allocation", SA-RU/SA-RO = ???

**Evidence AGAINST clear vowel-function mapping in S-R**:
1. SA-RU mostly precedes numerals (5/6), not commodities
2. SA-RO has mixed contexts
3. No consistent semantic contrast like total/deficit

**Conclusion**: S-R paradigm shows **formal** relationship (shared consonants) but NOT **functional** paradigm like K-R.

### 6.3 Alternative Interpretation

The S-R forms may include:
- **SA-RA2**: Administrative allocation term (Akkadian *saraku* loan?)
- **SA-RU**: Personal name (appears in counted/administrative contexts)
- **SA-RO**: Personal name OR transaction term
- **SI-RU**: Personal name
- **SA-RI**: Personal name OR variant

---

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 SA-RA2 Function: CONFIRMED

**SA-RA2 = Allocation marker** (PROBABLE confidence)

Evidence:
- 90% pre-logogram context (before COMMODITY + NUMERAL)
- Multi-commodity distribution (GRA, CYP, OLE, VIR)
- Follows KU-RO (totals) and personal names
- Structural parallel to Akkadian palace economy terminology

### 7.2 Geographic Distribution: HT-SPECIFIC

| Term | HT | Non-HT |
|------|----|----|
| SA-RA2 | 20 (100%) | 0 (0%) |
| All S-R | 34 (89%) | 4 (11%) |

SA-RA2 is an **HT-specific administrative term**. The broader S-R paradigm has limited spread to PKZ, ZA, SAMW.

### 7.3 S-R Paradigm: NOT COHERENT

Unlike K-R (KU-RO/KI-RO with clear total/deficit contrast), the S-R forms do NOT show:
- Consistent vowel-function mapping
- Shared semantic domain
- Paradigmatic alternation

**Recommendation**: Treat SA-RA2 as distinct lexeme, not paradigm member.

### 7.4 Functional Equivalents: NOT FOUND

No term at KH, ZA, or PH performs the same function as SA-RA2.

**Implications**:
1. Other sites may have had different allocation terminology
2. Or allocation was marked differently (contextually, not lexically)
3. Document type bias may affect comparability

### 7.5 Universal vs. HT-Specific: HT-SPECIFIC

**SA-RA2 is NOT a universal Linear A administrative term**.

It appears to be specific to Hagia Triada's scribal/accounting practice, possibly reflecting:
- HT's role as redistribution center
- Specialized accounting vocabulary
- Possible Akkadian loanword (regional adoption)

2. Analyze KH document types for functional differences
3. Test whether SI-RU at PKZ functions like SA-RA2

### Medium-Term
4. Compare HT allocation documents with KH transaction documents
5. Map SA-RA2 tablet find-spots within HT complex
6. Develop "HT administrative vocabulary" subset

### Long-Term
7. Create site-specific reading guidelines
8. Test Akkadian *saraku* hypothesis on new inscriptions
9. Investigate why KH lacks allocation terminology
