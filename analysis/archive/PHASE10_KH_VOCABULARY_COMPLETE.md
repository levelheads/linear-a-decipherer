# Phase 10: Khania (KH) Vocabulary Analysis - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Analyst**: Claude (OPERATION MINOS III - Phase 10)
**Purpose**: Complete analysis of high-frequency vocabulary at Khania, investigating signs *164, *306, *401+RU, SI, the CYP compound system, and vessel sealings

---

## Executive Summary

Khania represents a **fundamentally autonomous administrative tradition** within the Linear A corpus. This analysis confirms and extends the Phase 8 findings:

1. **Complete absence of K-R paradigm**: KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA2 are entirely absent from 227 KH inscriptions
2. **Copper-dominated commodity system**: CYP with compound modifiers (CYP+D, CYP+E) showing specialized trade vocabulary
3. **Unique sealing system**: Single-sign roundels (*411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS, *164, *301+*311) indicating distinct archival practices
4. **High-frequency signs with specific functions**: *164 = textile marker; *306 = commodity qualifier; *401+RU = liquid measure compound

**Key Conclusion**: KH operated a **parallel administrative tradition** focused on copper trade and vessel-based commodity storage, distinct from HT's palatial accounting system.

## 1. High-Frequency Sign Analysis

### 1.1 *164 (13 occurrences at KH)

#### Distribution Pattern

| Inscription | Context | Format |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| KHWc2036-2045 | Roundels | Single sign only |
| KHWc2095-2096 | Roundels | Single sign only |
| HT 17 | Tablet | RA-*164-TI TE VIN 37 |
| HT 19 | Tablet | RA-*164-TI TE VIN 30 |

**Critical Observation**: At KH, *164 appears **exclusively on roundels** as a single-sign marker. At HT, it appears in the compound RA-*164-TI as a personal name/title before wine allocations.

#### Sign Description

The corpus translates *164 as "textile?" - suggesting a textile commodity logogram based on pictographic analysis.

#### Function Analysis

| Feature | KH Pattern | HT Pattern |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Context | Roundel sealing | Tablet transaction |
| Format | Standalone | RA-*164-TI compound |
| Co-occurrence | None (single sign) | VIN, TE |
| Proposed meaning | Textile commodity marker | Personal name element |

#### Hypothesis: *164 = Textile Commodity Logogram

**Evidence FOR**:
- 13/13 KH occurrences are on roundels (vessel sealings)
- Single-sign usage suggests commodity/content indicator
- Roundels with single logograms typically mark container contents
- Parallel to *411-VS, *409-VS which also appear as single roundel signs

**Evidence AGAINST**:
- HT attestations (RA-*164-TI) show it in personal name context
- If it means "textile," why does RA-*164-TI appear with VIN (wine)?

**Resolution**: *164 may have **dual function**:
1. As standalone: Commodity logogram (textile/cloth)
2. In compounds: Syllabic value contributing to names

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (function as commodity marker at KH; uncertain elsewhere)

---

### 1.2 *306 (7 occurrences at KH)

#### Distribution Pattern

| Inscription | Context | Associated Commodity |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| KH 2 | Tablet | *306-CYP+E (compound with copper) |
| KH 4 | Tablet | *306 4, CYP 1/3 |
| KH 6 | Tablet | AU-RE-TE *306 1 |
| KH 11 | Tablet | *306, *306 (two occurrences) |
| KH 19 | Tablet | *306-VIR+*307 |
| KH 21 | Tablet | *306-QE-DU |
| KH 84 | Tablet | *301 1, *306, *401+RU |
| KH 87 | Tablet | *306 (fragmentary) |

#### Pattern Analysis

*306 at KH shows **consistent association with CYP (copper)**:
- *306-CYP+E: Compound combining *306 with copper variant
- Appears in lists alongside CYP amounts
- Often followed by small quantities or fractions

#### Cross-Site Comparison

| Site | *306 Forms | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| HT | *306-TU (4x), *306-TU-JA, *306-KI-TA2 | Personal names |
| KH | *306-CYP+E, *306-VIR+*307, *306-QE-DU | Commodity qualifiers |

**Divergence**: At HT, *306 appears in **personal name compounds** (-TU, -JA). At KH, it appears in **commodity/logogram compounds** (-CYP+E, -VIR).

#### Hypothesis: *306 = Commodity Qualifier at KH

*306 appears to function as a **commodity type modifier** at KH, potentially indicating:
- Quality grade
- Processing state
- Origin designation
- Specialized category

**Confidence**: LOW-MEDIUM (consistent pattern but insufficient to determine meaning)

---

### 1.3 *401+RU (7 occurrences at KH)

#### Distribution Pattern

| Inscription | Context | Associated Signs |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| KH 12 | Tablet | CYP 2, *308 1/2, MI+JA+RU 1/2... *401+RU |
| KH 17 | Tablet (damaged) | Near numerals |
| KH 83 | Tablet | A-DI-NE 15, *401+RU |
| KH 84 | Tablet | CYP 1/2, *301 1, *306, *401+RU |
| KH 85 | Tablet | OLE+TA 1/2, *308, *401+RU 1/16, *131C |
| KH 88 | Tablet | (fragmentary) |
| KH 91 | Tablet | (fragmentary) |

#### Pattern Analysis

*401+RU appears in **multi-commodity lists** alongside:
- CYP (copper)
- OLE+TA (olive oil variant)
- *308 (olive oil logogram)
- Various fractions (1/2, 1/16, 1/5)

**Key Observation**: *401+RU frequently co-occurs with **liquid commodities** (oils) and **fractions**.

#### Hypothesis: *401+RU = Liquid Measure or Container Type

**Evidence FOR**:
- Co-occurrence with OLE variants and *308
- Associated with fractional quantities
- Compound structure (logogram + syllable RU)
- Position after commodities suggests measurement/container

**Evidence AGAINST**:
- Also appears with CYP (not a liquid)
- Limited attestation prevents verification

**Confidence**: SPECULATIVE (consistent position but function undetermined)

---

### 1.4 SI (6 occurrences at KH)

#### Distribution Pattern

At KH, SI appears in various contexts:

| Inscription | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| KH 5 | A-DA-KI-SI-KA (personal name compound) |
| KH 16 | U-TA-I-SI CYP (before copper) |
| Various | As syllable in compounds |

#### Cross-Site Comparison

SI is the **3rd most frequent syllabogram corpus-wide** (237 total occurrences). At KH, it maintains typical syllabic distribution without specialized function.

**Function at KH**: Standard syllabic sign; no special administrative function identified.

**Confidence**: CERTAIN (normal syllabic usage)

---

## 2. CYP Compound System Analysis

### 2.1 CYP Dominance at KH

| CYP Form | KH Count | HT Count | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| CYP (base) | 36 | 15 | KH dominant |
| CYP+D | 17 | 2 | KH exclusive variant |
| CYP+E | 11 | 2 | KH exclusive variant |
| Total CYP | **64** | 19 | 3.4x ratio |

**CYP represents 14% of all KH vocabulary tokens** (64/473), compared to ~2% at HT.

### 2.2 CYP+D vs CYP+E Analysis

#### CYP+D (17 occurrences)

| Inscription | Pattern | Quantity |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| KH 6 | CYP+D 1/2 (multiple entries) | Fractional |
| KH 7a | CYP+D (in multi-commodity list) | Various |
| KH 7b | CYP+D | Various |
| KH 8 | CYP+D | Various |
| KH 9 | CYP+D | Various |
| KH 11 | CYP+D | Various |
| KH 32 | CYP+D | Various |
| KH 33 | CYP+D | Various |

**CYP+D Pattern**: Appears with **fractional quantities** (1/2, 1/3, 1/4), suggesting either:
- A subdivision of copper weight
- A specific copper quality/grade
- A processing state (ore vs. refined)

#### CYP+E (11 occurrences)

| Inscription | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| KH 2 | *306-CYP+E |
| KH 5 | WI-SA-SA-NE CYP+E 2 |
| KH 7a | CYP+E with fractions |
| KH 11 | CYP+E 3 |
| KH 20 | A-SI-KI-RA CYP+E 1/3 |
| KH 34 | CYP+E 2 |
| KH 54 | CYP+E 1 |
| KH 58 | NI CYP+E 1 1/4, A CYP+E 4 |

**CYP+E Pattern**: Associated with **personal names** (WI-SA-SA-NE, A-SI-KI-RA) and **small integer quantities**.

### 2.3 Comparative Hypothesis: D vs E Suffixes

| Suffix | Frequency | Typical Quantity | Proposed Meaning |
|--------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| +D | 17 | Fractional (1/2, 1/3) | Raw/unprocessed copper OR weight subdivision |
| +E | 11 | Small integers (1-4) | Refined copper OR standard ingots |

**Parallel with HT OLE System**:

At HT, olive oil (OLE) shows similar suffix differentiation:
| HT Form | Count | Proposed Function |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| OLE+U | 22 | Primary/finest grade |
| OLE+KI | 21 | Processed/filtered |
| OLE+MI | 19 | Secondary grade |

**Hypothesis**: CYP+D and CYP+E follow the same **acrophonic abbreviation** pattern as OLE variants, indicating copper grades or processing states.

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (pattern parallel but meanings undetermined)

---

## 3. Vessel Sealing System (*4XX-VS Signs)

### 3.1 Distribution

| Sign | KH Count | Support Type | Other Sites |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| *411-VS | 15 | Roundel | None |
| *409-VS | 4 | Roundel | 1 (KO) |
| *408-VS | 4 | Roundel | None |
| *417-VS | 2 | Roundel | None |

**All 25 occurrences are on roundels (KHWc series).**

### 3.2 Scribal Attribution

| Sign | Primary Scribe |
|------|----------------|
| *411-VS | KH Wc Scribe 54 (12/15 occurrences) |
| *417-VS | KH Wc Scribe 53 |
| *409-VS | Mixed |
| *408-VS | Mixed |

**Observation**: *411-VS is strongly associated with a single scribe (80% of occurrences), suggesting either:
- Personal or workshop mark
- Specialized commodity designation
- Quality certification stamp

### 3.3 Other Single-Sign Roundel Types

| Sign | KH Count | Proposed Meaning |
|------|----------|------------------|
| *164 | 13 | Textile commodity |
| *301+*311 | 9 | Unknown compound |
| *86+*188 | 8 | Unknown compound |

### 3.4 Vessel Sealing Hypothesis

**Function Analysis**:

| Hypothesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Content Indicators** | Single-sign format matches commodity logograms; roundels seal vessels | Same sign on multiple vessels implies non-unique content |
| **Merchant Marks** | Scribe concentration suggests individual attribution; *411-VS dominance | Would expect more variation per person |
| **Quality Stamps** | Standardized format; limited vocabulary | Cannot verify quality gradation |
| **Origin Marks** | KH-exclusivity suggests local production | No geographic variation within KH |

**Most Likely**: **Content Indicators** with secondary function as **workshop/quality certification**.

The KH roundel system represents a **sealing practice for vessel contents**, where:
- *411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS indicate specific commodities or grades
- *164 marks textiles
- *301+*311 marks an unknown commodity class

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (function as sealings certain; specific meanings undetermined)

## 4. Functional Equivalence Matrix

### What Does KH Use Instead of HT Terms?

| HT Function | HT Term | KH Equivalent | Status |
|-------------|---------|---------------|--------|
| **TOTAL** | KU-RO (35x) | **NONE** | No totaling markers found |
| **DEFICIT** | KI-RO (16x) | **NONE** | No deficit vocabulary |
| **ALLOCATION** | SA-RA2 (20x) | **NONE** | No allocation term |
| **Wine measure** | VIN (28x) | VIN (7x) | Shared but less common |
| **Grain** | GRA (45x) | GRA (8x) | Shared but less common |
| **Copper** | CYP (15x) | **CYP (64x)** | DOMINANT at KH |
| **Oil variant** | OLE+U, OLE+KI, OLE+MI | OLE+TA (5x) | Different variant |
| **Vessel marking** | Rare | **Roundel system** | KH exclusive |
| **Textile marker** | ? | ***164** | KH exclusive |

### KH Administrative System Characteristics

| Feature | HT Pattern | KH Pattern |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Document type | Commodity lists with totals | Individual transactions |
| Summation | KU-RO totaling | NO totaling |
| Primary commodity | Mixed (VIN, GRA, OLE) | CYP (copper) dominant |
| Secondary commodities | Various | Limited variety |
| Sealing practice | Multi-sign nodules | Single-sign roundels |
| Deficit tracking | KI-RO notation | None visible |

---

## 5. Multi-Hypothesis Testing

### CYP Compound Suffixes (+D, +E)

| Hypothesis | Luwian | Semitic | Pre-Greek | Proto-Greek |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Quality grades | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE |
| Processing state | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE |
| Acrophonic abbreviation | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE |

**Result**: No hypothesis discriminates. All four frameworks permit commodity subdivision marking.

### *164 = Textile

| Hypothesis | Luwian | Semitic | Pre-Greek | Proto-Greek |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Logogram value | NEUTRAL | NEUTRAL | NEUTRAL | NEUTRAL |
| If syllabic value | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |

**Result**: Logogram interpretation is hypothesis-neutral.

### Absence of K-R Paradigm at KH

| Hypothesis | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Luwian** | KU-RO/*kull is Semitic; absence at KH may indicate less Semitic influence |
| **Semitic** | KH may use different Semitic terminology or indigenous vocabulary |
| **Pre-Greek** | KU-RO may be HT innovation; KH represents separate tradition |
| **Proto-Greek** | Regional administrative variation within Minoan world |

**Significant Negative Evidence**: The COMPLETE absence of K-R vocabulary at KH (0/227 inscriptions) argues against a universal Minoan administrative vocabulary borrowed from any single language.

---

## 6. Negative Evidence Summary

### What KH Lacks (Compared to HT)

| Feature | HT Status | KH Status | Significance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| KU-RO | 35 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **NO totaling** |
| KI-RO | 16 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **NO deficit tracking** |
| SA-RA2 | 20 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **NO allocation term** |
| OLE+U/KI/MI | ~60 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **Different oil vocabulary** |
| PO-TO-KU-RO | ~10 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **NO grand totals** |
| Multi-sign nodules | Common | Rare | **Different archival practice** |

### What KH Has (Not at HT)

| Feature | KH Status | HT Status | Significance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| *411-VS | 15 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **Unique sealing** |
| *409-VS | 4 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **Unique sealing** |
| *408-VS | 4 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **Unique sealing** |
| *417-VS | 2 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **Unique sealing** |
| CYP+D | 17 occurrences | 2 occurrences | **KH copper variant** |
| CYP+E | 11 occurrences | 2 occurrences | **KH copper variant** |
| *86-RO | 4 occurrences | 0 occurrences | **KH exclusive** |

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1 KH Administrative System Reconstruction

Based on corpus analysis, Khania operated a **distinct administrative system** characterized by:

1. **Copper Trade Specialization**: CYP dominates the commodity vocabulary (64 occurrences = 14% of tokens)

2. **Transaction-Based Records**: Individual commodity transactions without cumulative totaling (no KU-RO)

3. **Vessel-Based Storage**: Single-sign roundels mark container contents (*411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS, *164)

4. **Quality/Grade Differentiation**: CYP+D and CYP+E distinguish copper types (parallel to HT's OLE+U/KI/MI)

5. **Limited Vocabulary Overlap**: Only 1.8% Jaccard similarity with HT vocabulary

### 7.2 Sign Function Summary

| Sign | Count | Function at KH | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| *164 | 13 | Textile commodity logogram | MEDIUM |
| *306 | 7 | Commodity qualifier (copper-associated) | LOW-MEDIUM |
| *401+RU | 7 | Liquid measure or container | SPECULATIVE |
| SI | 6 | Standard syllable (no special function) | CERTAIN |
| *411-VS | 15 | Content/quality sealing | MEDIUM |
| *409-VS | 4 | Content/quality sealing | MEDIUM |
| *408-VS | 4 | Content/quality sealing | MEDIUM |

### 7.3 Implications for Linear A Decipherment

1. **Regional Vocabulary Variation is REAL**: The HT administrative vocabulary (KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA2) cannot be assumed universal. Readings based solely on HT data must be qualified.

2. **Semitic Administrative Vocabulary May Be HT-Specific**: If KU-RO = Semitic *kull* and SA-RA2 = Akkadian *sharaku*, these may represent HT's unique trade connections, not pan-Minoan practice.

3. **KH May Preserve Indigenous Minoan Vocabulary**: The absence of K-R paradigm forms may indicate KH used an older or more indigenous administrative vocabulary.

4. **Commodity Specialization Affects Vocabulary**: Sites developed vocabulary appropriate to their economic focus (copper at KH vs. agricultural products at HT).

## 8. First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [1] KOBER | PASS | Pattern analysis (frequency, position, co-occurrence) before interpretation |
| [2] VENTRIS | PASS | Abandoned assumption that HT vocabulary is universal |
| [3] ANCHORS | PASS | Built from logograms (CYP, VIN, GRA) and numerals outward |

---

## 9. Future Research Recommendations

1. **CYP+D/CYP+E Deep Dive**: Analyze fractional quantities to determine if D = weight subdivision and E = standard unit

2. **Roundel Sealing Study**: Compare KH roundel contents to find associated tablets

3. **Scribal Analysis**: Map KH Wc Scribe 54's full production to understand *411-VS significance

4. **Chronological Comparison**: Test if KH practices are earlier/later than HT system

5. **Textile Trade Investigation**: Search for textile-related inscriptions to verify *164 interpretation
