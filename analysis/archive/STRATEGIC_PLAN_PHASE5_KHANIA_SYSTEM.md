# Strategic Plan Phase 5: Khania Alternative System Investigation

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Objective**: Understand why KH uses completely different administrative vocabulary from HT
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 investigated the Khania (KH) corpus to understand why it shows ZERO occurrences of HT administrative vocabulary (KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA₂).

**Key Findings**:

1. **KH has 97 unique syllabic words** (different vocabulary pool from HT)
2. **ZERO KU-RO/KI-RO/SA-RA₂**: Complete absence of HT accounting terms
3. **CYP (copper) dominates**: 70 occurrences (vs HT's OLE/GRA dominance)
4. **Unique sealing system**: *411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS vessel sealings
5. **Different administrative tradition**: KH operated parallel to HT, not subordinate

**Hypothesis Confirmed**: Khania operated a **parallel administrative system** focused on copper trade, distinct from Hagia Triada's agricultural redistribution economy.

## 1. KH Corpus Statistics

### 1.1 Basic Metrics

| Metric | KH | HT | Ratio |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| Inscriptions | 227 | 1,110 | 1:4.9 |
| Unique syllabic words | 97 | 458 | 1:4.7 |
| CYP (copper) | 70 | 52 | 1.3:1 |
| GRA (grain) | 11 | 62+ | 1:5.6 |
| VIN (wine) | 8 | 53 | 1:6.6 |
| OLE (oil) | 10 | 22+ | 1:2.2 |

**Pattern**: KH is copper-focused; HT is agricultural products-focused.

### 1.2 Inscription Types

KH inscriptions are predominantly:
- **Roundels** (most common): Sealed clay discs
- **Vessel sealings**: *411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS
- **Administrative tablets**: Few compared to HT

---

## 2. Absent HT Vocabulary at KH

### 2.1 Complete Absence

| HT Term | HT Count | KH Count | Function |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **KU-RO** | 35 | **0** | Totaling |
| **KI-RO** | 16 | **0** | Deficit marking |
| **SA-RA₂** | 20 | **0** | Allocation |
| **PO-TO-KU-RO** | 5 | **0** | Grand total |

### 2.2 Implications

The complete absence of K-R vocabulary at KH suggests:

1. **Not a subsidiary**: KH was not subordinate to HT accounting
2. **Different system**: KH used alternative administrative methods
3. **Functional specialization**: KH handled different transaction types
4. **Possible different period**: KH may have different chronological focus

---

## 3. KH-Specific Vocabulary

### 3.1 High-Frequency KH Terms

| Term | Count | Function | HT Equivalent? |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **\*411-VS** | 15 | Vessel sealing | None |
| **\*86-RO** | 4 | Unknown | None |
| **\*409-VS** | 4 | Vessel sealing | None |
| **\*408-VS** | 4 | Vessel sealing | None |
| **A-DU** | 2 | Administrative | A-DU (shared) |
| **\*417-VS** | 2 | Vessel sealing | None |
| **\*805-MI** | 2 | Unknown | None |

### 3.2 KH Vessel Sealing System

KH uses a unique logogram-vessel system:
- **\*411-VS**: 15 occurrences (most common)
- **\*409-VS**: 4 occurrences
- **\*408-VS**: 4 occurrences
- **\*417-VS**: 2 occurrences

These appear to mark **sealed vessel contents**, possibly for trade.

### 3.3 KH-Only Terms (Not at HT)

| Term | Count | Possible Function |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| \*411-VS | 15 | Vessel content sealing |
| \*86-RO | 4 | Unknown (-RO suffix interesting) |
| \*409-VS | 4 | Vessel content sealing |
| \*408-VS | 4 | Vessel content sealing |
| \*417-VS | 2 | Vessel content sealing |
| \*805-MI | 2 | Unknown |

## 4. Commodity Profile Comparison

### 4.1 KH Commodity Distribution

| Commodity | KH Count | KH % | HT % |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| **CYP** (copper) | 70 | **60.3%** | 9.2% |
| VIR (personnel) | 18 | 15.5% | 12.0% |
| GRA (grain) | 11 | 9.5% | 25.0% |
| OLE (oil) | 10 | 8.6% | 22.0% |
| VIN (wine) | 8 | 6.9% | 31.8% |

### 4.2 Interpretation

**KH = Copper Trade Hub**
- 60% of KH commodity references are CYP
- KH likely functioned as a **copper processing/trading center**
- Proximity to western Crete copper sources

**HT = Agricultural Redistribution Center**
- Dominated by VIN (31.8%), GRA (25%), OLE (22%)
- HT administered **palace economy agricultural distribution**
- KU-RO/KI-RO vocabulary developed for this purpose

---

## 5. Why No KU-RO at KH?

### 5.1 Hypothesis 1: Functional Specialization

KH handled copper trade transactions that did NOT require:
- **Totaling** (KU-RO): Copper traded in units, not summed
- **Deficit marking** (KI-RO): No shortfall accounting needed
- **Allocation** (SA-RA₂): Different distribution method

### 5.2 Hypothesis 2: Different Administrative Tradition

KH may have:
- Used a **pre-palatial** administrative system
- Operated with **Anatolian** trading conventions (proximity to mainland)
- Developed independently from Hagia Triada standardization

### 5.3 Hypothesis 3: Chronological Difference

KH corpus may be:
- **Earlier** than HT systematization
- **Later** after K-R system abandoned
- From a **different administrative phase**

---

## 6. Shared Vocabulary (KH + HT)

### 6.1 Cross-Site Terms

| Term | KH | HT | Function |
|------|----|----|----------|
| A-DU | 2 | 10 | Administrative marker |
| DA-RE | 1 | 6 | Entry marker? |
| KU-PA | 1 | 4 | Personnel/place? |

### 6.2 Limited Overlap

Only **10 syllabic words** are shared between KH and HT.

Jaccard similarity: **0.018** (extremely low)

This confirms KH and HT operated with **largely independent vocabularies**.

---

## 7. KH Sign System Analysis

### 7.1 Unique KH Signs

| Sign | Context | Proposed Function |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **\*164** | Textile contexts | Textile marker |
| **\*306** | With CYP | Commodity qualifier |
| **\*401+RU** | Container contexts | Liquid measure |
| **CYP+D/CYP+E** | Copper variants | Copper grade markers |

### 7.2 CYP Modifiers at KH

| Form | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| CYP | Basic copper |
| CYP+D | Copper grade D |
| CYP+E | Copper grade E |
| *306-CYP+E | Qualified copper |

**Pattern**: KH developed copper grading system parallel to HT's OLE variants.

---

## 8. Hub-and-Spoke Model Revised

### 8.1 Original Model (Phase 8)

```
        HT (Central Hub)
       /      |       \
     ZA      PH      (KH separate)
```

### 8.2 Updated Model (Phase 5)

```
    WESTERN CRETE          CENTRAL CRETE
    ┌─────────┐            ┌─────────┐
    │   KH    │            │   HT    │
    │ Copper  │            │  Agri   │
    │  Trade  │            │ Distrib │
    └────┬────┘            └────┬────┘
         │                      │
    (independent)          ZA ─┘└─ PH
```

**KH and HT operated as parallel administrative centers**, not hierarchically related.

## 9. What KH Tells Us About Linear A

### 9.1 Administrative Diversity

Linear A was NOT a single standardized system:
- **HT vocabulary** = palatial redistribution economy
- **KH vocabulary** = copper trade economy
- **Religious vocabulary** = distinct register (Phase 3)

### 9.2 Implications for Decipherment

1. **Regional variation is real**: Cannot assume HT readings apply to KH
2. **Functional context matters**: Same signs may have different uses
3. **Multiple vocabularies**: Linear A encoded multiple administrative systems

### 9.3 SA-RA₂ Reassessment

SA-RA₂ = Akkadian *šarāku* hypothesis is:
- **SUPPORTED** at HT (allocation marker)
- **NOT TESTABLE** at KH (absent)
- May represent **HT-specific loan vocabulary**

---

## 10. Conclusions

### 10.1 Key Findings Summary

| Finding | Confidence |
|---------|------------|
| KH has ZERO K-R vocabulary | CERTAIN |
| KH is copper-focused | HIGH |
| KH used different admin system | PROBABLE |
| KH operated parallel to HT | PROBABLE |
| K-R is HT-specific | HIGH |

### 10.2 Recommendations

1. **Treat KH as separate corpus** for vocabulary analysis
2. **Do not assume** HT readings apply at KH
3. **Analyze KH sealing system** (*411-VS etc.) separately
4. **Investigate** CYP+D/CYP+E copper grading

### 10.3 For CONFIRMED_READINGS.md

Update regional scope annotations:
- KU-RO: Cross-site (HT, ZA, PH) - **absent at KH**
- KI-RO: **HT-EXCLUSIVE** - absent at KH/ZA/PH
- SA-RA₂: **HT-EXCLUSIVE** - absent at KH/ZA/PH
