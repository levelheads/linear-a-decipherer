# Khania (KH) Vocabulary Analysis

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Analyst**: Claude (OPERATION MINOS III)
**Purpose**: Investigate high-frequency vocabulary at Khania, the 2nd largest Linear A corpus with ZERO K-R paradigm forms

---

## Executive Summary

Khania (KH) represents a **fundamentally different administrative system** than Hagia Triada (HT). Analysis of 227 KH inscriptions reveals:

1. **No totaling terminology**: KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA2 are completely absent
2. **Copper-dominated economy**: CYP (copper) and compounds appear 64+ times
3. **Different document structure**: Individual transactions without list summation
4. **Unique sealing system**: 101 vessel sealings with KH-exclusive signs (*411-VS, etc.)

**Key finding**: The HT "palatial accounting system" (KU-RO/KI-RO/SA-RA2) is NOT universal Minoan. KH operated a parallel administrative tradition.

## NI Analysis

### Distribution

- **26 occurrences at KH** (vs. 41 at HT)
- Appears in **list-final position** 12 times (46%)
- Always followed by a number or fraction

### Positional Pattern

```
KH5:  ... KU-PA-ZU CYP 3 ≈1/6 NI 2 (fraction)
KH15: CYP 1/2 NI 1/2 NI 1/4
KH20: ... CYP+E 1/2 NI 1/4
KH30: (damaged) NI 9
```

### Hypothesis Testing: Is NI = "Total"?

**Test**: Do numbers after NI equal the sum of preceding entries?

| Inscription | Sum Before NI | Number After NI | Match? |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| KH5 | 7.17 | 2 | NO |
| KH15 | 1.0 | 0.25 | NO |
| KH20 | 0.83 | 0.25 | NO |

**Conclusion**: NI is **NOT a totaling term**. Numbers after NI do not equal preceding sums.

### Alternative Hypotheses for NI

1. **Commodity type**: NI measured alongside copper with fractional quantities
2. **Transaction marker**: Indicates a specific type of allocation
3. **Unit designation**: A measurement unit for copper trade
4. **Conjunction**: Separates different items in a list

## Structural Comparison: HT vs KH

### HT 13 (Classic Commodity List)

```
KA-U-DE-TA VIN TE        (Heading: [name] wine [transaction])
RE-ZA         5½         (Entry 1: [name] amount)
TE-TU         56         (Entry 2)
TE-KI         27½        (Entry 3)
KU-ZU-NI      18         (Entry 4)
DA-SI-*118    19         (Entry 5)
I-DU-NE-SI    5          (Entry 6)
KU-RO         130½       (TOTAL)
```

**Pattern**: NAME QUANTITY repeated, ends with KU-RO TOTAL (which equals sum)

### KH 6 (Longest KH Tablet)

```
CYP+D 1/2                (Copper compound, fraction)
DI-SI                    (Name?)
TE-NU-RE                 (Name?)
KI-SA-NE CYP+D 1/2      (Name + copper + fraction)
*347                     (Unknown)
CYP 1/2                  (Copper, fraction)
RI-TA-JE CYP+D          (Name + copper)
... (continues)
CYP 2 (fraction)         (Final: copper + amount, NO TOTAL MARKER)
```

**Pattern**: [NAME] COMMODITY FRACTION repeated, NO totaling term at end

## Vessel Sealings (*4XX-VS)

### Unique to KH

| Sign | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| *411-VS | 15 | Single-sign sealing |
| *409-VS | 4 | Single-sign sealing |
| *408-VS | 4 | Single-sign sealing |
| *417-VS | 2 | Single-sign sealing |

### Interpretation

These are **single-sign nodules** (KHWc series) - clay sealings attached to vessels or containers. They appear to be:
- Authentication marks
- Content indicators
- Trade/shipping tags

This archival practice is **absent at HT**, suggesting different administrative procedures for storing/shipping goods.

---

## Shared Vocabulary: HT-KH

Only **10 syllabic words** appear at both sites:

| Word | HT Count | KH Count | Likely Function |
|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| A-DU | 7 | 2 | Personal name or title |
| DA-RE | 5 | 1 | Unknown |
| KU-PA | 3 | 1 | Unknown (name?) |
| RE-ZA | 2 | 1 | Personal name |
| DA-I | 1 | 1 | Unknown |
| QA-NU-MA | 1 | 1 | Unknown |
| A-RA | 1 | 1 | Unknown |
| DI-NA | 1 | 1 | Unknown |
| PI-SA | 1 | 1 | Unknown |
| SI-CYP | 1 | 1 | Copper compound |

**Jaccard similarity**: 0.018 (1.8% vocabulary overlap)

---

## Conclusions

### 1. KH Uses a Different Administrative Paradigm

The absence of KU-RO/KI-RO/SA-RA2 is not accidental. KH operated a **parallel administrative system** characterized by:
- Individual transaction records (not cumulative lists)
- Fractional copper measurements (specialized trade)
- Vessel sealings for shipping/storage

### 2. The "Semitic Administrative Layer" May Be HT-Specific

The Semitic loan hypothesis (KU-RO = *kull*, SA-RA2 = *sharaku*) applies to HT vocabulary. KH may have:
- Different loan sources
- Indigenous vocabulary
- Parallel trade terminology

### 3. NI Requires Further Investigation

NI appears functional but is NOT equivalent to KU-RO. Possible interpretations:
- A commodity (measured with fractions)
- A transaction type marker
- Further analysis needed across full corpus

### 4. Regional Administrative Independence

KH represents an **administratively independent center** during the Neopalatial period:
- Different vocabulary systems
- Different document structures
- Different sealing practices

---

## Implications for First Principles

### Principle #6 (Cross-Corpus Consistency)

**FAILED for K-R paradigm**: KU-RO/KI-RO/SA-RA2 are HT-specific, not corpus-wide.

**Recommendation**: Downgrade confidence for any reading based solely on HT distribution.

### Hypothesis Rankings

| Hypothesis | HT Evidence | KH Evidence | Combined |
|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Semitic (administrative) | STRONG | UNKNOWN | Reduced |
| Luwian (morphology) | MODERATE | Untested | Unchanged |
| Pre-Greek (substrate) | MODERATE | Untested | Unchanged |

## Future Research

1. **Identify KH-specific transaction vocabulary**
   - What terms serve administrative functions at KH?
   - Are they indigenous or borrowed?

2. **Analyze copper trade terminology**
   - CYP compounds (CYP+D, CYP+E, CYP+K) - what do suffixes mean?
   - Fractional amounts - what measurement system?

3. **Compare sealing practices**
   - Are *4XX-VS signs merchant marks?
   - Do they indicate origin or contents?

4. **Test NI across full corpus**
   - Distribution at other sites (ZA, PH)
   - Contextual analysis
