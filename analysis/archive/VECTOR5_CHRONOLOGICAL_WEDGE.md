# VECTOR 5: The Chronological Wedge

**Objective**: Track vocabulary evolution across 400-year timeline to identify indigenous vs. contact vocabulary

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Phase**: Period Stratification Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Linear A spans MMII (1800 BCE) to LMIB (1450 BCE). Analysis reveals vocabulary EVOLVED:
- **MMII** (earliest): Pure name lists with NO numerals and NO K-R vocabulary
- **MMIII**: KU-RO appears = K-R INNOVATION HORIZON
- **LMIB** (mature): Full K-R system with SA-RA₂, KI-RO, PO-TO-KU-RO

This chronological stratification identifies **pre-contact** Minoan vocabulary.

## Corpus by Period

### Quantitative Summary

| Period | Date Range | Inscriptions | Unique Words | K-R Terms |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **MMII** | 1800-1700 BCE | ~25 | 33 | **ZERO** |
| **MMIII** | 1700-1600 BCE | ~50 | 150 | KU-RO (1) |
| **LMIA** | 1600-1500 BCE | ~30 | 112 | ZERO |
| **LMIB** | 1500-1450 BCE | ~1,000+ | 1,199 | **ALL K-R** |
| Unknown | — | — | 11 | ZERO |

## K-R Vocabulary by Period

### The K-R Innovation Horizon

| Term | MMII | MMIII | LMIA | LMIB |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| **KU-RO** | ❌ | **1** (PH(?)31a) | ❌ | **36** |
| **KI-RO** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **16** |
| **SA-RA₂** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **20** |
| **PO-TO-KU-RO** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **2** |
| **KU-RE** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | **2** |

**Key Finding**: KU-RO appears in MMIII (PH(?)31a) — this is the **K-R INNOVATION HORIZON**.

**Implication**: Semitic administrative vocabulary (*kull* = "total") was adopted by MMIII, not LMIB. The full K-R system developed over ~200 years.

## MMII Vocabulary Analysis (Pre-K-R Phase)

### MMII Document Types

| Type | Example | Content | K-R? |
|------|---------|---------|------|
| Name lists | PH 6 | I-NA-WA, A-RI, I-ZU-RI-NI-TA | ❌ |
| Wine records | PH 25 | VIN 2 | ❌ |
| Hide inventories | PH 10 | HIDE+[?] | ❌ |
| Nodules | PHWc series | Single terms | ❌ |

### MMII Vocabulary Characteristics

| Feature | MMII | LMIB Comparison |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Numerals** | Rare (wine only) | Ubiquitous |
| **Totaling** | ABSENT | KU-RO system |
| **Name format** | Long (5-6 syllables) | Shorter (2-4) |
| **Logograms** | VIN, HIDE | Full inventory |

### MMII Name Morphology

From PH 6 (pure name list):
- I-NA-WA
- A-RI (repeated - structural marker?)
- I-ZU-RI-NI-TA (6 syllables!)
- I-DA-PA₃-I-SA-RI (7 syllables!)

**Observations**:
1. Names are LONGER than LMIB names
2. Initial I- common (prothetic vowel?)
3. A-RI repeated — may be title or structural marker
4. Complex syllable sequences suggest Pre-Greek substrate

**Linguistic Implications**:
- Pre-Greek name patterns visible in earliest phase
- Name shortening may reflect language contact/simplification
- MMII preserves more archaic forms

## MMIII Vocabulary Analysis (Innovation Horizon)

### PH(?)31a: The Earliest KU-RO

**Full Text**:
```
A | RU | CAPm+KU 1 | MA-DI *21M 1 | *22F | NE 1 |
KU-PA₃-NU AU-SI-RE 1 | PA-TA-DA 1 | KU-RO CAPm+KU 1 | *21M 5 | *21F 3
```

**Analysis**:
- **KU-RO** appears in list-final position
- **CAPm+KU** = male goat with modifier
- **\*21M/\*21F** = gender classifiers
- Names: MA-DI, KU-PA₃-NU, AU-SI-RE, PA-TA-DA

**Implication**: By MMIII, the totaling concept (KU-RO) is established, but the full K-R system (KI-RO, SA-RA₂) has not yet developed.

### MMIII Distinctive Vocabulary

| Term | Count | Context |
|------|-------|---------|
| HIDE+[?] | 8 | Hide inventories (Malia) |
| *21M/*21F | 5+ | Gender classifiers |
| *412+E | 3 | Unknown |
| *316 | 3 | Unknown |

**Note**: Gender classifiers (*21M/*21F) are prominent in MMIII — confirms grammatical gender system from VECTOR 1.

├── Name lists only
├── No quantification system
├── Pre-Greek substrate dominant

## Terms by First Appearance

### MMII-Only Vocabulary (Archaic/Indigenous)

These terms appear in MMII and may be lost or replaced:

| Term | MMII | MMIII | LMIB | Status |
|------|------|-------|------|--------|
| I-NA-WA | ✓ | ? | ? | Archaic name |
| I-ZU-RI-NI-TA | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | Lost |
| I-DA-PA₃-I-SA-RI | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | Lost |
| TI-TI-MA | ✓ | ? | ? | Archaic name |
| A-RI | ✓ | ? | ? | Title? Marker? |

### MMIII-Only Vocabulary

| Term | MMIII | LMIB | Status |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| QE-DE-MI-NU | ✓ | ? | Malia-specific? |
| AU-SI-RE | ✓ | ✓ | Continues |
| CAPm+KU | ✓ | ? | Specific goat type |

### LMIB Innovations

Terms that first appear in LMIB:

| Term | Pre-LMIB | LMIB | Status |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| KI-RO | ❌ | ✓ | New in LMIB |
| SA-RA₂ | ❌ | ✓ | New in LMIB |
| PO-TO-KU-RO | ❌ | ✓ | New in LMIB |
| KU-RE | ❌ | ✓ | New in LMIB |
| A-DU | ? | ✓ | Primarily LMIB |

## Regional Chronology Comparison

### Phaistos vs. Hagia Triada

| Feature | Phaistos | Hagia Triada |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Earliest tablets | **MMII** | LMIB |
| KU-RO first | **MMIII** | LMIB |
| K-R complete | — | **LMIB** |

**Implication**: Phaistos may be the **ORIGIN SITE** for K-R vocabulary, later adopted by HT as the administrative center.

### Khania Chronology

| Feature | Khania | HT |
|---------|--------|-----|
| K-R vocabulary | ZERO | Complete |
| Period | LMIB | LMIB |

**Implication**: Khania's LMIB tablets lack K-R despite being contemporary with HT. This is not chronological — it's **regional/functional**.

---

## Hypothesis: Pre-Greek Substrate Dating

### Vocabulary Layer Model

| Layer | Date | Vocabulary | Hypothesis Support |
|-------|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Pre-Contact** | MMII | Name morphology, basic commodities | Pre-Greek |
| **Contact Layer** | MMIII+ | KU-RO, accounting terms | Semitic |
| **Full Integration** | LMIB | Complete K-R system | Semitic + Luwian |

### Evidence for Pre-Greek in MMII

1. **Long names** (5-7 syllables) — typical of Pre-Greek toponyms
2. **Prothetic I-** — Pre-Greek feature (cf. I-ko-ro, I-to-no)
3. **No Semitic vocabulary** — contact layer not yet present
4. **No complex accounting** — indigenous record-keeping

---

## Implications for Decipherment

### 1. K-R System is LMIB Innovation at HT

The full K-R accounting system (KU-RO + KI-RO + SA-RA₂ + PO-TO-KU-RO) is a **LMIB Hagia Triada development**, not universal Minoan.

### 2. KU-RO Predates the Full System

KU-RO appears in MMIII Phaistos, ~200 years before the full system. The totaling concept was adopted early; deficit/allocation terms (KI-RO, SA-RA₂) came later.

### 3. MMII Preserves Pre-Contact Minoan

MMII tablets show Minoan vocabulary BEFORE Semitic contact:
- Long Pre-Greek names
- No accounting terminology
- Simple commodity records

### 4. Khania is NOT Chronological Anomaly

Khania's zero K-R is not because tablets are earlier — they're LMIB like HT. The difference is **functional/regional**, not temporal.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. K-R Innovation Horizon = MMIII

KU-RO first appears at MMIII Phaistos (PH(?)31a).
- **Before MMIII**: No K-R vocabulary
- **MMIII**: KU-RO only
- **LMIB**: Full K-R system

### 2. Vocabulary Stratification Confirmed

| Stratum | Date | Characteristic Terms |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| Archaic | MMII | Long names, I- prothetic |
| Innovative | MMIII | KU-RO, gender classifiers |
| Mature | LMIB | KI-RO, SA-RA₂, PO-TO-KU-RO |

### 3. Phaistos May Be Origin Site

KU-RO appears at Phaistos in MMIII, predating HT corpus. Phaistos may be where K-R vocabulary was first adopted.

### 4. Name Shortening Over Time

| Period | Typical Name Length | Example |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| MMII | 5-7 syllables | I-DA-PA₃-I-SA-RI |
| LMIB | 2-4 syllables | DA-NE, KU-PA₃ |

This may reflect language simplification, script economy, or contact influence.

## Cross-Vector Synthesis

### With VECTOR 1 (Dropped Signs)

Gender classifiers (*21F/*21M) appear strongly in MMIII — confirms grammatical classifier system identified in VECTOR 1.

### With VECTOR 3 (Khania)

Khania's zero K-R is confirmed as **regional**, not chronological. LMIB Khania and LMIB HT are contemporary but use different vocabulary.

### With VECTOR 4 (Knossos Scepter)

Scepter is LMIB (sanctuary context, 2024 excavation). Should show mature vocabulary period. Awaiting publication to compare.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Map ALL MMII vocabulary for Pre-Greek analysis
- [ ] Search for MMII vocabulary surviving into LMIB
- [ ] Analyze name morphology evolution quantitatively

### Phase 2
- [ ] Date all analyzed inscriptions using archaeological context
- [ ] Track specific terms across periods (appearance/disappearance)
- [ ] Compare Khania vocabulary with MMII Phaistos (test for archaic retention)

### Phase 3
- [ ] Build period-stratified phoneme inventory
- [ ] Test if unique signs (*301, *304) have chronological patterns
- [ ] Synthesize with Contact Language model
