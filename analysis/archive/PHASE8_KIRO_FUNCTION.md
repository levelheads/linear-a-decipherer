# Phase 8 Track A2: KI-RO Function Mapping

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Phase**: Operation MINOS Phase 8 Track A2
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis maps the function of KI-RO across all sites, examines its relationship to KU-RO within the K-R paradigm, and investigates why KI-RO appears exclusively at Hagia Triada (HT) despite significant administrative tablet collections at other sites.

**Key Findings**:
1. KI-RO is 100% exclusive to HT (16 occurrences, all at Hagia Triada)
2. KU-RO appears at HT, ZA, and PH (37 total occurrences)
3. No K-R paradigm deficit terms found at KH, ZA, or PH
4. The K-R paradigm's U/I vowel polarity encodes total vs. deficit semantics
5. KI-RO's absence at non-HT sites is **functionally significant**, not merely preservation bias

### Context Type Distribution

| Context Type | KI-RO Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Preceded by NUMERAL | 11 | 69% |
| Preceded by SYLLABIC | 2 | 12.5% |
| INITIAL (no preceding) | 2 | 12.5% |
| Preceded by OTHER | 1 | 6% |

| Context Type | KI-RO Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Followed by NUMERAL | 9 | 56% |
| Followed by SYLLABIC | 5 | 31% |
| Followed by LOGOGRAM | 1 | 6% |
| FINAL (no following) | 1 | 6% |

### Key Context Patterns

**Pattern 1: KI-RO with Fractional Values**
HT123+124a shows KI-RO repeatedly with very small fractional quantities:
- KI-RO 1.3 (1 and 3/10)
- KI-RO .3 (3/10)
- KI-RO 3/4 (twice)
- KI-RO 6

These small values after KI-RO suggest "deficit" or "shortfall" from expected amounts.

**Pattern 2: KI-RO Before KU-RO in Same Tablet**
Five inscriptions contain both:
- HT88: KI-RO (pos 12) ... KU-RO (pos 33)
- HT94b: KI-RO (pos 0) ... KU-RO (pos 18)
- HT117a: KI-RO (pos 2) ... KU-RO (pos 37)
- HT123+124a: 5x KI-RO ... 2x KU-RO
- HT123+124b: KU-RO (pos 31) ... KI-RO (pos 34)

**Critical Observation**: In HT123+124b, the sequence is:
```
... DU-MA-I-NA 3/8 | KU-RO 20 | KI-RO 5
```

This shows KI-RO (5) appearing AFTER KU-RO (20), suggesting:
- KU-RO = total for this section (20)
- KI-RO = deficit amount (5)
- Net position = 20 - 5 = 15 units

---

## 2. Relationship Analysis: KI-RO vs KU-RO

### Morphological Relationship

Both forms share the K-R consonantal skeleton:
- **KU-RO**: /ku-ro/ - back vowel /u/ + final /o/
- **KI-RO**: /ki-ro/ - front vowel /i/ + final /o/

The vowel alternation (U -> I) in the first syllable appears to encode semantic polarity:

| Feature | KU-RO | KI-RO |
|---------|-------|-------|
| First syllable vowel | U (back) | I (front) |
| Final syllable | -RO | -RO |
| Proposed polarity | POSITIVE | NEGATIVE |
| Function | Total/sum | Deficit/shortfall |
| Count | 37 | 16 |
| Position tendency | List-final | Variable |
| Following values | Large (often >50) | Small (often <10 or fractional) |

### Statistical Comparison

| Metric | KU-RO | KI-RO |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total occurrences | 37 | 16 |
| MEDIAL position | 33 (89%) | 13 (81%) |
| INITIAL position | 4 (11%) | 2 (12.5%) |
| FINAL position | 0 (0%) | 1 (6.5%) |
| Preceded by NUMERAL | 30 (81%) | 11 (69%) |
| Followed by NUMERAL | 29 (78%) | 9 (56%) |
| Followed by SYLLABIC | 0 (0%) | 5 (31%) |
| Multi-site | 3 sites | 1 site (HT only) |

### Complementary Distribution Analysis

**Result: NOT in complementary distribution**

Shared contexts:
- MEDIAL_OTHER_NUMERAL
- MEDIAL_NUMERAL_NUMERAL
- MEDIAL_NUMERAL_LOGOGRAM

This overlap suggests KI-RO and KU-RO are **semantically distinct** but can occur in similar syntactic environments, not mere allomorphs.

### Semitic Etymology Support

| Word | Proposed Semitic Cognate | Meaning |
|------|--------------------------|---------|
| KU-RO | *kull / *kol | "all, totality, whole" |
| KI-RO | *gara | "to diminish, reduce, lack" |

Both roots share the K-R biconsonantal frame, with vowel quality distinguishing positive (totality) from negative (diminution).

## 3. K-R Variants at Other Sites

### Search Results for K-R Forms

**Pattern searched**: K[AEIOU]-R[AEIOU]

| Form | HT | KH | ZA | PH | MIZ | ARKH | Total |
|------|----|----|----|----|-----|------|-------|
| KU-RO | 35 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 37 |
| KI-RO | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 |
| KU-RE | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| KI-RA | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| KU-RA | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| KI-RU | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| KA-RU | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

### Key Observations

1. **KI-RO is absolutely absent outside HT**
   - 0 occurrences at KH (99 tablets)
   - 0 occurrences at ZA (44 inscriptions)
   - 0 occurrences at PH (45+ inscriptions)

2. **KU-RO has limited non-HT presence**
   - ZA15b: KU-RO VIN 78
   - PH(?)31a: KU-RO CAPm+KU 1

3. **Alternative K-R forms at other sites**
   - ZA8: KI-RA A-TA-RE NI 1/2 (initial position)
   - ZA20: KU-RA 130 (with large numeral - total position)
   - ARKH2: SI-DA-TE KU-RA *131B 5

4. **KH has NO K-R forms whatsoever**
   - 99 tablets, 0 K-R paradigm words
   - This is statistically anomalous

---

## 4. Candidate "Deficit" Terms at Non-HT Sites

### Investigation Method

Searched for:
1. Words in positions where KI-RO would appear at HT
2. Words followed by small/fractional numerals
3. Words that might encode "shortfall" or "owed" semantically

### Khania (KH) - 99 tablets, 0 deficit markers

**Top syllabic words at KH**:
- NI (26), O (11), SI (6), ZE (6), A (6)

**Administrative patterns observed**:
- CYP (36) - copper/bronze commodity
- CYP+D (17), CYP+E (11) - commodity variants
- GRA (8), VIN (7) - standard commodities

**Assessment**: KH tablets appear to record commodity quantities without a visible deficit notation system. Either:
- Deficits were recorded on a separate (now lost) register
- KH administration used a different tracking method
- KH tablets represent complete transactions (no deficits)

### Zakros (ZA) - 44 inscriptions

**Relevant K-R variant**:
- ZA8: KI-RA A-TA-RE NI 1/2 (INITIAL position)

**Analysis of KI-RA at ZA8**:
- KI-RA shares the I-vowel (front) pattern with KI-RO
- But ends in -A rather than -O
- Position is INITIAL (header), not MEDIAL like most KI-RO
- May be: (a) dialectal variant of KI-RO, (b) different grammatical form, or (c) unrelated

**Other potential deficit markers at ZA**: None identified

### Phaistos (PH) - 45+ inscriptions

**KU-RO occurrence**:
- PH(?)31a: ... PA-TA-DA 1 | KU-RO CAPm+KU 1 *21M

**Deficit markers**: None identified

**Assessment**: PH tablets are primarily from earlier periods (MM III) and may predate the development of systematic deficit notation.

### Regional Vocabulary Divergence

**Jaccard Similarity Scores** (shared syllabic vocabulary):
- HT-KH: 0.018 (1.8% overlap)
- HT-ZA: 0.023 (2.3% overlap)
- HT-PH: 0.012 (1.2% overlap)
- KH-ZA: 0.009 (0.9% overlap)

This extremely low vocabulary overlap suggests:
- Regional administrative independence
- Possible dialectal variation
- Site-specific accounting practices

## 5. Is the K-R Paradigm Functional or Dialectal?

### Evidence for FUNCTIONAL Interpretation

1. **Systematic vowel polarity**
   - U-forms (KU-RO, KU-RE): appear at totaling positions with large values
   - I-forms (KI-RO): appear with small/fractional values, often marking shortfall

2. **Co-occurrence in same tablets**
   - 5 inscriptions show both KU-RO and KI-RO
   - They serve distinct roles within the same document

3. **Semitic root semantics**
   - *kull (total) vs *gara (diminish) provides morphemic basis
   - Vowel quality encodes semantic opposition

### Evidence for DIALECTAL Interpretation

1. **KU-RA at non-HT sites**
   - ZA20: KU-RA 130 (appears in total position)
   - ARKH2: SI-DA-TE KU-RA *131B 5
   - May be regional variant of KU-RO

2. **KI-RA vs KI-RO**
   - ZA8: KI-RA in header position
   - Could be dialectal -A ending at eastern sites

3. **Complete absence of K-R at KH**
   - Khania may have used entirely different terminology

### Synthesis

**The K-R paradigm is PRIMARILY FUNCTIONAL**, with possible dialectal overlay:

- The U/I vowel alternation encodes total vs. deficit (functional)
- The -O/-A/-E final vowel variation may encode case/position/dialect
- Regional sites (ZA, ARKH) may use -A variants of the same functional roots
- KH's complete lack of K-R suggests a different administrative tradition

---

## 6. Why is KI-RO Absent at Non-HT Sites?

### Hypothesis 1: Preservation Bias (UNLIKELY)

**Argument**: KI-RO tablets at other sites simply didn't survive.

**Counterevidence**:
- KH has 99 tablets - significant sample
- ZA has KU-RA (related form) but no KI-RO
- Statistical probability of 16 HT occurrences vs 0 elsewhere is very low if uniformly distributed

### Hypothesis 2: Hagia Triada Administrative Specialization (PROBABLE)

**Argument**: HT was the central accounting hub where deficits were tracked; other sites recorded only deliveries.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- HT has the largest tablet corpus (147 tablets)
- HT tablets show the most complex accounting structures
- Multi-tier hierarchy (PO-TO-KU-RO > KU-RO > KU-RE > KI-RO) only at HT
- Other sites may have sent goods to HT where shortfall was recorded

**Implication**: KI-RO marks deficits in a centralized accounting system based at Hagia Triada.

### Hypothesis 3: Dialectal Replacement (POSSIBLE)

**Argument**: Other sites used different words for "deficit."

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Vocabulary overlap between sites is <3%
- KI-RA at ZA8 might be the local equivalent
- KH may have used an entirely different term (unidentified)

**Problem**: No clear "deficit" candidates identified at KH/ZA/PH.

### Hypothesis 4: Functional Simplification (POSSIBLE)

**Argument**: Non-HT sites recorded only completed transactions; deficits were handled verbally or on perishable media.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Most non-HT tablets are simpler (fewer entries)
- Some may be single-transaction receipts
- Deficit tracking may have been a specialized HT function

### Most Likely Explanation

**Combination of Hypotheses 2 + 4**:

Hagia Triada served as the administrative center of the western Mesara plain, functioning as the hub for complex multi-commodity accounting. Other sites (KH, ZA, PH) may have:
1. Sent goods TO Hagia Triada (recorded as simple deliveries)
2. Received allocations FROM Hagia Triada (recorded with KU-RO totals)
3. Not tracked deficits locally (centralized at HT)

The KI-RO deficit notation was a specialized HT innovation for tracking shortfalls in a centralized redistribution system.

## 7. What Would We Expect if Deficits Were Recorded at KH/ZA/PH?

### Expected Patterns (Not Found)

1. **KI-RO or KI-RA with small values**
   - Expected: [Name] [Qty] | KI-RO/KI-RA [Small Qty]
   - Found at KH: None
   - Found at ZA: KI-RA (1x, header position - different pattern)
   - Found at PH: None

2. **Words with I-vowel in K-R pattern after numerals**
   - Expected: Similar positional pattern to HT
   - Found: None

3. **Fractional amounts with preceding syllabic word**
   - Expected: [WORD] 1/2, [WORD] 1/4, etc.
   - Found at KH: Various fractional amounts, but no consistent "deficit" marker
   - Found at ZA: Fractional amounts present, no deficit pattern

4. **Same-tablet total + deficit pairs**
   - Expected: [KU-RO/equivalent] [Large] ... [KI-RO/equivalent] [Small]
   - Found: Not observed outside HT

## 8. First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| P1 (Kober) | PASS | Analysis driven by distribution data, not language assumptions |
| P2 (Ventris) | PASS | Multiple hypotheses considered; limitations acknowledged |
| P3 (Anchors) | PASS | KU-RO/KI-RO function established via positional analysis (Level 4) before Semitic etymology (Level 6) |
| P4 (Multi-Hypothesis) | PASS | Semitic (*gara) and functional analysis both tested |
| P5 (Negative Evidence) | PASS | Absence of KI-RO at non-HT sites is central finding |
| P6 (Corpus) | PASS | All 16 KI-RO occurrences and 60+ K-R forms examined |

---

## 9. Conclusions

### Primary Findings

1. **KI-RO is HT-exclusive**: All 16 occurrences are at Hagia Triada. This is not random but reflects administrative organization.

2. **K-R vowel polarity is functional**: U-forms (KU-RO) mark totals; I-forms (KI-RO) mark deficits. This holds within HT and explains the paradigm structure.

3. **No equivalent deficit term at other sites**: Despite searching for positional and contextual equivalents, no "deficit" marker has been identified at KH, ZA, or PH.

4. **Regional variants exist but are sparse**: KU-RA (ZA, ARKH) and KI-RA (ZA) may be dialectal variants, but their low frequency (2 each) prevents definitive analysis.

5. **KH is administratively distinct**: With 99 tablets and zero K-R forms, Khania appears to have used a different accounting vocabulary entirely.

### Implications for Linear A Decipherment

1. **Hagia Triada was the central accounting hub**: The K-R paradigm (especially KI-RO) reflects specialized deficit-tracking that was centralized at HT.

2. **Regional variation is significant**: Low vocabulary overlap (1-3%) between sites suggests dialectal or functional differentiation.

3. **Semitic loanword layer**: The K-R paradigm shows strong Semitic morphology (*kull/*gara) suggesting contact with West Semitic traders.

4. **Administrative sophistication**: The three-tier system (PO-TO-KU-RO > KU-RO > KI-RO) indicates complex palatial accounting.

### Confidence Assessment

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| KI-RO means "deficit/shortfall" | HIGH |
| KI-RO is exclusive to HT | CERTAIN |
| U/I vowel encodes total/deficit polarity | HIGH |
| No equivalent deficit term exists at KH/ZA/PH | PROBABLE |
| KI-RA is a dialectal variant of KI-RO | SPECULATIVE |
| HT was the central accounting hub | PROBABLE |

## 10. Open Questions for Future Research

1. **What accounting terms did Khania use?**
   - 99 tablets with no K-R forms requires explanation
   - Were different logograms or abbreviations used?

2. **Is KI-RA at ZA8 a deficit term?**
   - Only 1 occurrence in header position
   - Needs more attestations to analyze

3. **Why does KU-RO appear at ZA and PH but not KI-RO?**
   - Were only "positive" totals recorded at peripheral sites?
   - Did deficit tracking require HT's centralized records?

4. **What happened to deficit records?**
   - Were "settled" deficits erased or recorded on different media?
   - Were tablets like HT123+124 working documents that accumulated deficits?
