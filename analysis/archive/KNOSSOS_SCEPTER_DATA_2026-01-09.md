## KN Zg 57 (Ivory Ring)

### Physical Description
- Material: Ivory (likely hippopotamus)
- Form: Cylindrical ring, hollow
- Diameter: ~6 cm (estimated from figures)
- Faces: 4 (A, B, C, D) with continuous inscription
- Condition: Some signs damaged/fragmentary

### Sign Count
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Completely/partially preserved | 84 |
| Small traces or probably present | 35 |
| **Total** | **~119** |

This is the **longest Linear A inscription ever discovered**.

### Scribe Characteristics
- Refined, calligraphic hand
- Style resembles Cretan Hieroglyphic more than typical Linear A tablets
- Different scribe from handle inscription
- **No numerals** - suggests ceremonial/religious rather than administrative function

### Face A Content

**Pictorial logograms**:
- 12 quadruped ideograms (possibly goat-like animals)
- 10 vase ideograms with syllabic ligatures indicating contents

**Identified signs on vases** (from paper):
| Sign | AB Number | Linear B Value | Context |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| RA | AB 60 | ra | Vase ligature |
| I | AB 28 | i | Vase ligature |
| NE | AB 24 | ne | Vase ligature |
| SE | AB 09 | se | Vase ligature |

**Special logogram**:
- Rhyton with bull's head: AB 664 (possible hieroglyphic connection)

**Interpretation**: Face A likely records offerings for a religious feast - animals and filled vessels.

### Face B Content

**Sign groups identified**: 6 distinct groups

**Logograms present**:
- GRA (grain)
- FAR (flour/barley)
- OLIV (olives)

**Potential vocabulary**:
| Sequence | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| KU-WI-A | Mentioned in paper (AB 81 + AB 40 + AB 08) |
| DI-KA-TA | Mentioned (AB 07 + AB 77 + AB 01) - possibly toponym Dikte? |

**Interpretation**: Commodities associated with offerings, possibly specifying quantities or types.

### Face C Content

**Sign groups identified**: 9 distinct groups

**Logograms present**:
- 5 textile-related ideograms (TELA variants)
- Possible cloth/fabric offerings

**Interpretation**: Textile offerings for religious ceremony.

### Face D Content

**Logograms present**:
- ~9 hide ideograms (AB 180)
- Possibly indicating animal hide offerings

**Interpretation**: Animal hide/leather offerings.

### Overall Ring Interpretation
The ring inscription appears to be a **ceremonial record of offerings** including:
- Animals (12 quadrupeds)
- Filled vessels (10 vases with contents indicated)
- Grain products (GRA, FAR)
- Olives (OLIV)
- Textiles (TELA)
- Hides (AB 180)

The absence of numerals and the refined calligraphic style distinguish this from administrative texts. The content suggests a major religious feast or dedication.

## KN Zg 58 (Ivory Handle)

### Physical Description
- Material: Ivory (matching ring)
- Form: Cylindrical handle, possibly originally connected to ring
- Faces: 4 (A, B, C, D)
- Condition: Some damage

### Scribe Characteristics
- Standard Linear A administrative hand
- Different scribe from ring inscription
- **Includes numerals and fractions** - clearly administrative function

### Content Overview

**Key feature**: Fractional notation sequence

The handle contains a sequence of **6 fraction signs** that may reveal their relative values:

| Fraction | Sequence Position | Possible Value |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| J | 1 | 1/2? |
| E | 2 | 1/4? |
| K | 3 | 1/8? |
| F | 4 | 1/16? |
| ? | 5 | ? |
| ? | 6 | ? |

> **Significant**: This sequence could help establish Linear A fraction values if the pattern represents a systematic progression.

### Administrative Nature
Unlike the ring, the handle inscription follows typical Linear A administrative conventions:
- Numerals present
- Fractions for precise quantities
- Layout resembles commodity accounting

## Paleographic Observations

### Ring vs. Handle Comparison

| Feature | Ring (KN Zg 57) | Handle (KN Zg 58) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Hand | Refined, calligraphic | Standard administrative |
| Numerals | Absent | Present |
| Fractions | Absent | Present (6+ signs) |
| Function | Ceremonial/religious | Administrative |
| Style | Hieroglyphic influence | Typical Linear A |

### Hieroglyphic Connections
The paper notes that certain signs on the ring show stylistic affinity with Cretan Hieroglyphic script, particularly:
- The rhyton with bull's head (AB 664)
- Some pictorial logograms

This may indicate:
1. Archaic features preserved in ceremonial contexts
2. Deliberate archaizing for religious texts
3. Transitional period between scripts

## AB Sign Numbers Confirmed in Paper

| AB Number | Linear B Value | Occurrence | Context |
|-----------|----------------|------------|---------|
| AB 01 | TA | Ring | DI-KA-TA sequence |
| AB 07 | DI | Ring | DI-KA-TA sequence |
| AB 08 | A | Ring | KU-WI-A sequence |
| AB 09 | SE | Ring | Vase ligature |
| AB 24 | NE | Ring | Vase ligature |
| AB 28 | I | Ring | Vase ligature |
| AB 40 | WI | Ring | KU-WI-A sequence |
| AB 60 | RA | Ring | Vase ligature |
| AB 77 | KA | Ring | DI-KA-TA sequence |
| AB 81 | KU | Ring | KU-WI-A sequence |
| AB 180 | — | Ring Face D | Hide logogram |
| AB 664 | — | Ring | Rhyton logogram |

## Significance for Decipherment

### New Data Volume
- 119 signs represents ~1.6% of entire known Linear A corpus in a single inscription
- Longest coherent text enables sequence analysis

### Dual Register Confirmation
Confirms Linear A was used for both:
1. Ceremonial/religious texts (ring - no numerals, refined style)
2. Administrative records (handle - numerals, standard style)

### Pattern Analysis Opportunities

**Vocabulary sequences to search corpus**:
- KU-WI-A (if genuine word)
- DI-KA-TA (possible toponym - compare to Greek Dikte?)

**Fraction sequence**: May establish relative values of Linear A fractions

**Logogram ligatures**: Vase + syllabic sign combinations may indicate commodity contents

### Questions for Further Research

1. Is DI-KA-TA related to Mount Dikte (Zeus's birthplace)?
2. What do the 12 quadrupeds represent - goats, cattle, or mixed?
3. Can the fraction sequence be solved mathematically?
4. Does KU-WI-A appear elsewhere in the corpus?
