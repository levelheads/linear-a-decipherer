## Prior Art and Attribution

Substantial prior scholarship exists on the morphology of the libation formula. This analysis builds on and extends that work, and specific attributions are noted throughout.

| Scholar | Year | Key Contribution | Our Extension |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------|
| Finkelberg | 1990 | Identified stem *una-(ru)-kana-*; proposed -TI as Anatolian 3rd person present/future; SYZa2 independent usage; comprehensive Anatolian parallels (Hittite, Luwian, Lycian) | SE-KA-NA-SI proves KA-NA (not *una-kana-*) is the minimal root; KA-NA functions independently in admin contexts |
| Duhoux | 1992 | Documented morphosyntactic variations in votive texts; proposed prefix i- = "to/in" | Broader systematic documentation of coordinated variation |
| Davis | 2014 | Correlated -SI/-TI alternation with number of dedicants; established VSO word order | Reframed as one dimension of a broader paradigm affecting all formula positions |
| Thomas | 2020 | Analysed polysynthetic verb morphology with subject and object agreement; case analysis | Complementary: our paradigm extends her agreement framework to simultaneous multi-word shift |
| Facchetti | 1999 | Statistical isolation of morphematic elements in Linear A | Template concept as productive cross-register pattern |

**What is NOT novel here**: The -SI/-TI alternation as verbal morphology (Finkelberg 1990), its correlation with dedicant number (Davis 2014), the identification of *una-(ru)-kana-* as a verbal stem (Finkelberg 1990), the Anatolian typological assessment (Finkelberg 1990), and the polysynthetic character of the formula verb (Thomas 2020).

**What IS novel**: (1) SE-KA-NA-SI prefix substitution proving KA-NA is the minimal root; (2) KA-NA as an independent administrative word bridging religious and economic registers; (3) U-...-SI as a cross-register productive grammatical template; (4) the coordinated Form A/B paradigm affecting all five formula positions simultaneously.

## Problem Statement

Prior scholarship has established that the libation formula contains verbal morphology with suffix alternation (Finkelberg 1990; Davis 2014; Thomas 2020). However, the variant forms have been analysed individually — as alternating endings on a single word — rather than as a **coordinated paradigm** in which every word in the formula simultaneously changes its suffix. This analysis demonstrates the paradigmatic nature of the variation and identifies new structural evidence (SE-KA-NA-SI, KA-NA administrative independence, U-...-SI template) that advances our understanding of the morphological architecture.

## The Discovery: PKZa11 as Inflectional Mirror

### The Standard Formula (IOZa2, Iouktas — most complete)

> A-TA-I-*301-WA-**JA** ... **JA-**SA-SA-RA-**ME** U-NA-KA-NA-**SI** I-PI-NA-**MA** SI-RU-**TE**

### The PKZa11 Variant (Palaikastro)

> A-TA-I-*301-WA-**E** ... SA-SA-RA-**ME** U-NA-RU-KA-NA-**TI** I-PI-NA-**MI-NA** SI-RU

### Aligned Comparison

| Formula Position | Standard (IOZa2) | Variant (PKZa11) | TLZa1 | Change |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| Position 1 (invocation) | A-TA-I-*301-WA-**JA** | A-TA-I-*301-WA-**E** | A-TA-I-*301-WA-**JA** | -JA → -E |
| Position 2 (action?) | **JA-**SA-SA-RA-ME | SA-SA-RA-ME | **JA-**SA-SA-RA-ME | JA- prefix dropped |
| Position 3 (verb/object?) | U-NA-KA-NA-**SI** | U-NA-RU-KA-NA-**TI** | U-NA-KA-NA | -SI → -TI; +RU infix; or ∅ |
| Position 4 (qualifier?) | I-PI-NA-**MA** | I-PI-NA-**MI-NA** | I-PI-NA-**MA** | -MA → -MI-NA |
| Position 5 (closing) | SI-RU-**TE** | SI-RU | SI-RU-**TE** | -TE dropped |

**Key observation**: The suffix changes are SIMULTANEOUS. Every word shifts between Form A and Form B together. This is grammatical agreement — the entire formula conjugates as a unit. (Individual suffix changes were noted by Finkelberg 1990 and Davis 2014; the coordinated multi-word paradigm framing is new.)

## Form A vs Form B

| Feature | Form A (Standard) | Form B (PKZa11) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Invocation suffix | -JA | -E |
| Action prefix | JA- present | JA- absent |
| Verb suffix | -SI | -TI (with -RU- infix) |
| Qualifier suffix | -MA | -MI-NA |
| Closing suffix | -TE | ∅ (dropped) |
| Sites attested | IO, KO, TL, PK, SY (5+) | PK (1) |

### What grammatical category distinguishes Form A from Form B?

The simultaneous shift across all five words eliminates lexical variation — this is not different vocabulary, it's the same formula in a different grammatical form. Candidates:

1. **Tense/Aspect**: Present vs. past offering ("we are pouring" vs "we poured") — POSSIBLE
2. **Mood**: Indicative vs. optative/subjunctive ("we pour" vs "may we pour") — POSSIBLE
3. **Voice**: Active vs. middle/passive ("pouring" vs "being poured") — WEAK (would not typically affect all words)
4. **Person**: 1st vs. 3rd person ("we offer" vs "they offer") — POSSIBLE
5. **Ritual register**: Different ceremony types (peak sanctuary vs cave sanctuary) — POSSIBLE but Form A appears at multiple sanctuary types

**Davis (2014) proposal**: Davis correlated the -SI/-TI alternation with the number of dedicants named on the vessel — PKZa11 (Form B, -TI) has two dedicants while most Form A inscriptions have one. This suggests **number agreement** rather than tense.

**Finkelberg (1990) proposal**: Finkelberg identified -TI as the Anatolian 3rd person present/future verbal ending (cf. Palaic, Luwian, Lycian), and *unarukanati* as a finite verb form vs *unakanane* (= *unakanasi* with the reading L 57 = *si*) as an infinitive.

**Thomas (2020) proposal**: Thomas's keywords — "subject agreement, object agreement" — suggest she analyses the suffix changes as agreement morphology on a polysynthetic verb.

**Our assessment**: The simultaneous shift across ALL five formula positions (not just the verb) goes beyond single-word agreement and suggests a paradigm-level phenomenon — whether triggered by number (Davis), tense/aspect, or some other category. The addition of -RU- infix in Form B (U-NA-RU-KA-NA-TI) may be an aspectual marker, as Finkelberg (1990) already noted this form represents a different verbal paradigm than the base *unakanasi*.

## The KA-NA Root System

### SYZa3: The SE- Prefix Discovery

SYZa3 (Syme): A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA **SE-KA-NA-SI** SI-RU-TE

**SE-KA-NA-SI** occupies the exact formula position of U-NA-KA-NA-SI. The root **KA-NA** is preserved; only the prefix changes (U-NA- → SE-). This proves:

1. **KA-NA is the stable root** — not U-NA-KA-NA
2. **U-NA- and SE- are interchangeable prefixes** on the same root
3. The word-boundary falls as: [PREFIX]-KA-NA-[SUFFIX]

### Full KA-NA Paradigm

| Prefix | Infix | Root | Suffix | Full Form | Context | Site |
|--------|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------|------|
| U-NA- | — | KA-NA | -SI | U-NA-KA-NA-SI | Libation formula | IO, KO, PK, SY |
| U-NA- | — | KA-NA | ∅ | U-NA-KA-NA | Libation formula | TL |
| U-NA- | -RU- | KA-NA | -SI | U-NA-RU-KA-NA-SI | Libation formula | IO |
| U-NA- | -RU- | KA-NA | -TI | U-NA-RU-KA-NA-TI | Libation formula | PK |
| U-NA- | -RU- | KA-JA | -SI | U-NA-RU-KA-JA-SI | Libation formula | PK |
| SE- | — | KA-NA | -SI | SE-KA-NA-SI | Libation formula | SY |
| JA-SA-U-NA- | — | KA-NA | -SI | JA-SA-U-NA-KA-NA-SI | Libation formula | PK |
| — | — | KA-NA | — | KA-NA | Administrative | HT |
| — | — | KA-NA | -NI-TI | KA-NA-NI-TI | Roundel label | KH |

Nine attested forms of the same root across 6 sites. This is one of the most productive paradigms in the entire Linear A corpus.

### KA-NA in Administrative Context

KA-NA appears standalone twice at Hagia Triada:

**HT23a**: KA-NA heads a commodity list including CYP (copper), oil varieties (OLE+NE, OLE+TU, OLE+RI), VIN (wine), and other goods. KA-NA appears to be a **list heading or category label**.

**HT123+124b**: KA-NA appears mid-list among items with quantities, in a tablet that totals to KU-RO 20 with KI-RO 5 (deficit 5). KA-NA is an **entry in an allocation list**.

**Interpretive leap** (SPECULATIVE): If KA-NA means something like "offering" or "provision/allocation," then:
- Administrative KA-NA = "provision/allocation" (category of goods)
- Religious U-NA-KA-NA-SI = "the [making of] provision/offering" (ritualized form with grammatical prefixes and suffixes)
- The same root spans religious and administrative registers, which is consistent with Minoan palace economy where religious offerings and administrative allocations were economically intertwined

### The U-...-SI Template

U-NA-KA-NA-SI is not unique — it belongs to a productive grammatical template:

| Word | Root | Context | Site |
|------|------|---------|------|
| U-NA-KA-NA-SI | KA-NA | Religious (libation) | IO, KO, PK, SY |
| U-MI-NA-SI | MI-NA | Administrative (personnel + commodities) | HT |
| U-*34-SI | *34 | Administrative | HT |
| U-TA-I-SI | TA-I | Administrative (?) | KH |

The template U-[X]-SI applies different roots across both religious and administrative contexts. This means U- and -SI are **general grammatical morphemes**, not ritual-specific vocabulary. The semantic content is in the root (KA-NA, MI-NA, *34, TA-I); U- and -SI contribute grammatical function.

**Speculative proposal** (POSSIBLE): U- may be a **verbal/agentive prefix** (marking the word as an action or agent), and -SI may be a **present/indicative suffix** (alternating with -TI for a different tense/aspect). This would make U-NA-KA-NA-SI a verbal noun or participle: "the U-[doing of]-KA-NA-[in present form]."

### U-MI-NA-SI in Administrative Context

**HT117a**: MA-KA-RI-TE KI-RO **U-MI-NA-SI** — followed by a list of 10 personal names, each counted as 1, totaling KU-RO 10.

U-MI-NA-SI appears to be a **group designation or institutional role** for 10 workers. KI-RO (deficit/category) precedes it, suggesting this is a categorical label.

**HT28b**: A-SI-JA-KA **U-MI-NA-SI** — followed by SA-RA₂ GRA 20, OLE+DI 5, NI 2, VIN 4...

U-MI-NA-SI appears alongside SA-RA₂ (our "allocate" candidate) in a commodity distribution. A-SI-JA-KA may be a personal name or institutional label, and U-MI-NA-SI a category or role.

## The KA-JA / KA-NA Alternation

PKZa12 attests **U-NA-RU-KA-JA-SI** where we would expect U-NA-RU-KA-NA-SI. The element KA-**NA** alternates with KA-**JA**.

This could mean:
1. **NA and JA are morphophonemic alternants** — conditioned by an environment we haven't identified
2. **JA replaces NA** as a suffix/case marker on the root KA- (making the root even shorter: just KA-)
3. **Scribal variant or dialectal form** (PKZa12 is from Palaikastro, same as PKZa11)

If the root is just KA-, then KA-NA and KA-JA are both inflected forms of KA-. This would make the paradigm even richer — KA takes suffixes -NA (standard) and -JA (variant) before the outer -SI/-TI suffix. A possible interpretation: KA-NA-SI and KA-JA-SI represent different oblique cases of the same root.

## Toward a Minoan Verbal Morphology (SPECULATIVE)

Assembling all the evidence, a tentative morphological schema emerges:

```
[OUTER PREFIX] - [INNER PREFIX] - [ROOT] - [INNER SUFFIX] - [OUTER SUFFIX]
     JA-SA           U-NA          KA         -NA/-JA          -SI/-TI
                     SE-           MI          -NA              -∅
                     U-            *34
                                   TA-I

Outer prefix: JA-SA- (intensifier? honorific? ritual marker?)
Inner prefix: U- (verbal/agentive), U-NA- (verbal + directional?), SE- (different verb frame?)
Root: KA, MI, *34, TA-I (lexical content)
Inner suffix: -NA (standard), -JA (variant), -RU- (infix: aspectual?)
Outer suffix: -SI (Form A), -TI (Form B), -∅ (base form)
```

### Language Typology Assessment

**Note**: Finkelberg (1990) already demonstrated comprehensive Anatolian parallels for the libation formula, comparing Minoan morphological features to Hittite, Luwian, Lycian, and Lydian in a detailed feature-by-feature analysis. The typological assessment below is largely consistent with her findings.

This morphological structure is **agglutinative** — meaning is built by layering affixes onto roots, with each affix carrying one grammatical function. This is consistent with:

- **Pre-Greek substrate**: Beekes documents extensive prefixal and suffixal variation in Pre-Greek words, including -s-/-t- alternations
- **Anatolian (Luwian/Lycian)**: Has agglutinative features with prefix chains and suffixal case/tense marking. Finkelberg (1990) provides 13 specific morphological correspondences with Anatolian languages
- **Inconsistent with**: Semitic (which uses root-and-pattern morphology, not prefix chains) and Proto-Greek (which uses fusional inflection). This exclusion was also noted by Finkelberg (1990, pp. 46-47)

The -SI/-TI alternation is particularly diagnostic:
- Finkelberg (1990) identified -TI as the Anatolian 3rd person present/future ending (Palaic, Luwian, Lycian)
- Pre-Greek (per Beekes) shows systematic s/t alternation: Parnass-os / Parnatt-os, plinth-os / pliss-os
- This alternation does NOT occur productively in Semitic or Greek

**Assessment**: The inflectional paradigm favors **Anatolian or Pre-Greek** affiliation, consistent with Finkelberg (1990). Our new evidence adds: (1) the infixation (-RU-) is not typical of known Anatolian languages, tipping slightly toward Pre-Greek substrate; (2) the U-...-SI template operating across both religious and administrative registers suggests this morphology is not ritual-specific but pervasive in Minoan grammar.

**Speculation** (label: SPECULATIVE, falsifiable): Minoan may represent a **Pre-Anatolian substrate language** — typologically agglutinative like Anatolian languages but genetically pre-dating them, with substrate features (infixation, reduplication) that were later absorbed into Pre-Greek. This would reconcile Finkelberg's Anatolian parallels with the Pre-Greek phonological patterns (s/t alternation, -ss-) documented by Beekes — they may reflect the same linguistic layer viewed from different perspectives.

## Toward Meaning: What Does U-NA-KA-NA-SI Mean? (SPECULATIVE)

Working from context inward:

1. **The formula appears on stone libation vessels at peak sanctuaries** — the objects were used to pour offerings (oil, wine) to deities
2. **U-NA-KA-NA-SI-OLE** (SYZa2) carries the OLE determinative — directly associating the word with oil
3. **KA-NA** appears in administrative commodity lists — suggesting it means something like "offering" or "provision"
4. **U-...-SI** is a grammatical template appearing in both religious and administrative contexts — it's a verbal/nominal form
5. **The formula inflects** — meaning it describes an action, not just names participants

**Prior interpretations**:
- **Finkelberg (1990)**: Rendered the formula as "to pay *ipinama* in such-and-such manner," interpreting it as stipulating fines or payments for misuse of votive objects. She compared Minoan *ida* to Luwian/Lycian *ijasa-*/*ijetê* ("to buy/acquire") and proposed the inscriptions function as property-protection texts.
- **Gordon (2003)**: "pouring libations" — via Etruscan comparison (methodologically flawed; see our earlier review).

**Our assessment** (SPECULATIVE): U-NA-KA-NA-SI likely refers to **the act of making an offering/provision**, or **the offering itself as a ritual action**. The new evidence of KA-NA standalone in commodity allocation lists (HT23a, HT123+124b) supports a semantic domain of "provision/offering/allocation" — compatible with both Finkelberg's "payment" interpretation and the broader ritual context. The -SI form may be present/indicative or infinitive (Finkelberg), while -TI (Form B) may be a finite verb form.

The independent attestation of KA-NA in administrative contexts is key: it suggests the root meaning is economic/transactional ("provision, allocation"), which Minoan religion and administration share — consistent with Minoan palace economy where religious offerings and economic allocations were intertwined.

## Falsification Criteria

1. **Inflectional paradigm falsified if**: PKZa11's suffix changes are shown to be scribal errors rather than systematic variation. Test: find another "Form B" inscription — if it shows the same pattern of simultaneous suffix changes, the paradigm is confirmed.
2. **KA-NA root hypothesis falsified if**: SE-KA-NA-SI is shown to have a different root (e.g., SE-KA + NA-SI rather than SE + KA-NA + -SI). Test: find SE-KA in non-KA-NA contexts.
3. **Agglutinative typology falsified if**: Minoan shows fusional or root-and-pattern morphology in non-formula contexts. Test: examine administrative word formation for evidence of non-agglutinative patterns.
4. **Verbal interpretation falsified if**: U-NA-KA-NA-SI appears in non-action contexts (e.g., as a pure noun without any verbal morphology in administrative lists). Note: KA-NA standalone may be the base noun, which does not falsify the verbal interpretation of U-NA-KA-NA-SI.
5. **The -SI/-TI = tense hypothesis falsified if**: Form A and Form B inscriptions are shown to come from the same ritual context, same period, same site — eliminating tense as the distinguishing factor.

```

## Impact

### Confirming established findings (with new evidence)
1. **The libation formula actively inflects** — established by Finkelberg (1990), Davis (2014), Thomas (2020); our aligned comparison table systematises the evidence
2. **Language typology is Anatolian or Pre-Greek** — Finkelberg (1990) demonstrated this comprehensively; our -RU- infixation evidence and cross-register template add new data points

### Genuinely novel contributions
3. **SE-KA-NA-SI (SYZa3) proves KA-NA is the minimal root**: Where Finkelberg identified stem *una-(ru)-kana-*, the SE- prefix substitution demonstrates the morpheme boundary falls at KA-NA, not *una-kana-*. This is the first direct evidence of prefix variability on this root.
4. **KA-NA bridges religious and administrative registers**: Standalone KA-NA in HT23a (commodity list heading) and HT123+124b (allocation entry) shows the root operates independently in economic contexts — not previously noted in the literature.
5. **U-...-SI is a productive cross-register grammatical template**: U-MI-NA-SI (admin, HT), U-*34-SI (admin, HT), U-TA-I-SI (KH) share the same morphological frame as U-NA-KA-NA-SI (religious). This generalises the morphology beyond the libation formula.
6. **Coordinated Form A/B paradigm**: The simultaneous suffix changes across all 5 formula positions (not just the verb) represent a paradigm-level phenomenon. Prior work documented individual variant forms; the coordinated nature across positions is new.
7. **KA-NA paradigm table**: 9 attested forms of the same root across 6 sites — the most productive paradigm documented for any Linear A root.

## Next Steps

1. **Search for additional Form B inscriptions** to confirm the inflectional paradigm is systematic, not idiosyncratic to PKZa11
2. **Map all -SI/-TI alternation pairs** across the full corpus — is this alternation productive beyond the formula?
3. **Investigate SE-** prefix: does SE- appear as a prefix on other roots? If so, it may mark a different verbal category
4. **Compare the U-MI-NA-SI paradigm**: Can MI-NA take the same range of prefixes and suffixes as KA-NA?
5. **Test KA-NA / KA-JA alternation**: Is -JA a case form of -NA, or a different morpheme entirely? Check distribution contexts
6. **Build paradigm table for I-PI-NA-MA / I-PI-NA-MI-NA**: The -MA/-MI-NA alternation may reveal additional inflectional categories
7. **Obtain and review Thomas (2020)**: Full text behind paywall — her subject/object agreement analysis may overlap with or extend our Form A/B paradigm
8. **Test Finkelberg's "payment" interpretation** against KA-NA administrative attestations: If KA-NA in HT23a/HT123+124b means "provision/allocation," does this support or conflict with Finkelberg's "to pay *ipinama*"?
