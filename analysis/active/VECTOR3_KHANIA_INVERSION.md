# VECTOR 3: The Khania Inversion

**Objective**: Exploit the parallel system to find indigenous Minoan vocabulary

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Phase**: Systematic Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Khania (227 inscriptions) has **ZERO** K-R vocabulary. If K-R terms are Semitic loans specific to HT palatial accounting, Khania may preserve **indigenous Minoan** administrative vocabulary predating Semitic contact.

**Key Finding**: Khania operates a **PARALLEL** administrative system focused on copper (CYP) trade, distinct from HT's agricultural redistribution model.

## Confirmed Findings

### Zero K-R Vocabulary at Khania

| Term | HT Count | KH Count | Difference |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| KU-RO | 37 | **0** | HT-exclusive |
| KI-RO | 17 | **0** | HT-exclusive |
| SA-RA₂ | 20 | **0** | HT-exclusive |
| PO-TO-KU-RO | 5 | **0** | HT-exclusive |

**Confidence**: CERTAIN (exhaustive corpus search)

## CYP+D vs CYP+E Analysis

### Distribution Pattern

| Feature | CYP+D | CYP+E |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Total occurrences** | 23 | 14 |
| **KH occurrences** | 17 | 11 |
| **HT occurrences** | 6 | 3 |
| **Typical quantity** | Fractions (½, ⅓) | Integers (1-20) |

### Detailed Quantity Analysis

**CYP+D quantities observed**:
- ½ (8 occurrences) - most common
- ⅓ (2 occurrences)
- 1 (3 occurrences)
- 3 (1 occurrence)

**CYP+E quantities observed**:
- 1-4 (common)
- 2 (3 occurrences)
- 3 (2 occurrences)
- 20 (1 occurrence - HT)

### Proposed Interpretation

| Grade | Pattern | Hypothesis |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **CYP+D** | Small fractions dominant | Lower grade/quality copper |
| **CYP+E** | Integers dominant | Higher grade/quality copper |

**Alternative Hypotheses**:
1. **Quality grades**: D = impure/unrefined; E = refined
2. **Origin markers**: D = one source; E = another source
3. **Processing stages**: D = raw; E = processed
4. **Weight classes**: D = partial units; E = standard units

**Confidence**: PROBABLE (consistent quantity patterns)

## KH-Exclusive Vocabulary

### *411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS (Vessel Sealings)

| Sign | Occurrences | Context |
|------|-------------|---------|
| *411-VS | 15 | Vessel content sealings |
| *409-VS | 4 | Vessel content sealings |
| *408-VS | 4 | Vessel content sealings |

These appear on clay sealings for vessels. "-VS" likely indicates vessel sealing function.

### *164 (Textile Marker?)

| Occurrences | 13 |
|-------------|-----|
| **Sites** | KH exclusive |
| **Context** | Often with personnel? |

May represent textile category or production marker - needs further analysis.

### *86+*188 (Unique Ligature)

| Occurrences | 8 |
|-------------|---|
| **Sites** | KH dominant |
| **Pattern** | Two unique signs combined |

*86 is 58% Khania-concentrated (from VECTOR 1). Combined with *188, may represent KH-specific term.

---

## Functional Equivalents to K-R

### Problem: No Totaling Term

Khania has NO equivalent to KU-RO for totaling. Possible explanations:

1. **Different document types**: KH = distribution records, not inventories requiring totals
2. **Indigenous term exists but unrecognized**: May look different from K-R
3. **No totaling convention**: KH accounting didn't sum entries
4. **Damaged/lost**: Totaling sections not preserved

### Search for Potential Totaling Terms

Looking for words appearing with large numbers (≥10):

| Term | Large Number Context | Potential Function |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| VIR+[?] | 140, 60, 10 | Personnel total? |
| GRA | 10, 90 | Grain total? |
| SU | 12, 10 | Unknown term? |

**Note**: These appear in commodity contexts, not as standalone totaling markers.

### Candidate: *401+RU

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Occurrences** | 7 |
| **Sites** | KH (6), Other (1) |
| **Pattern** | Appears with liquid commodities |

*401+RU may be KH-specific liquid measure. Could function as subtotal or category marker.

**Confidence**: SPECULATIVE

---

## Commodity Focus Comparison

| Commodity | HT | KH | Ratio |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| OLE (oil) | 100+ | 5 | 20:1 HT dominant |
| VIN (wine) | 83 | 7 | 12:1 HT dominant |
| GRA (grain) | 128+ | 8 | 16:1 HT dominant |
| **CYP (copper)** | **52** | **64** | **1:1.2 KH dominant** |
| NI | Low | 26 | KH dominant |

**Key Finding**: Khania is a **COPPER TRADE CENTER**, not agricultural redistribution.

## Hypothesis: Indigenous vs. Contact Vocabulary

### Model

| Layer | HT Vocabulary | KH Vocabulary | Age |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| **Indigenous** | Toponyms, names | CYP grading, *411-VS, *164 | Pre-contact |
| **Contact** | KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA₂ | Absent | Contact period |

**Implication**: Khania may preserve **pre-contact** Minoan administrative vocabulary that was replaced at HT by Semitic loans.

### Test: Chronological Comparison

If KH vocabulary is older:
- Should appear in early MMII Phaistos tablets
- Should NOT appear in late LMIB HT tablets

**Status**: Pending VECTOR 5 chronological analysis

---

## Vocabulary Overlap Analysis

### HT-KH Vocabulary Jaccard Similarity: 1.8%

Only 1.8% vocabulary overlap between the two sites.

### Shared Terms

| Term | HT | KH | Likely Function |
|------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| CYP | Yes | Yes | Copper (universal) |
| GRA | Yes | Yes | Grain (universal) |
| VIN | Yes | Yes | Wine (universal) |
| *301 | Yes | Yes | Unknown phoneme/logogram |
| NI | Yes | Yes | Unknown commodity |

### HT-Exclusive Terms (sample)

KU-RO, KI-RO, SA-RA₂, A-DU, PO-TO-KU-RO, *303, ...

### KH-Exclusive Terms (sample)

*411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS, *164, *86-RO, *401+RU, ...

---

## Implications for Decipherment

### 1. Two Administrative Systems

Linear A encodes **at least two** distinct administrative systems:
- HT system with Semitic loan vocabulary
- KH system with (possibly indigenous) copper trade vocabulary

### 2. Semitic Layer is HT-Specific

The Semitic loanwords (KU-RO, SA-RA₂) may represent **HT palatial innovation**, not universal Minoan.

### 3. KH May Preserve Older Minoan

If KH vocabulary predates Semitic contact, it may provide:
- Indigenous Minoan administrative terms
- Non-Semitic numerical/quantity vocabulary
- Pre-Greek substrate vocabulary

### 4. CYP Grading System

CYP+D/CYP+E represents a **quality grading system** for copper:
- Similar to HT's OLE+U/OLE+KI oil grading
- Indigenous Minoan practice (not Semitic loan)
- May help decode other modifier systems

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Copper Trade Focus CONFIRMED
Khania is specialized in copper (CYP) trade with quality grading (D/E).

### 2. Zero K-R Vocabulary CONFIRMED
No totaling (KU-RO), deficit (KI-RO), or allocation (SA-RA₂) terms at Khania.

### 3. Distinct Administrative Vocabulary
KH-exclusive signs: *411-VS, *409-VS, *408-VS, *164, *86+*188

### 4. CYP+D = Fractional, CYP+E = Integer Quantities
- CYP+D typically with ½, ⅓ (lower grade?)
- CYP+E typically with 1, 2, 3+ (higher grade?)

### 5. Indigenous Vocabulary Candidate
KH system may preserve pre-Semitic-contact Minoan administrative vocabulary.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Analyze full inscription content of KH tablets with CYP
- [ ] Search for arithmetic verification (sums) in KH tablets
- [ ] Compare *411-VS content with HT vessel sealings

### Phase 2
- [ ] Map *164 distribution and context
- [ ] Analyze *86+*188 occurrences
- [ ] Compare KH vocabulary with MMII Phaistos (chronological test)

### Phase 3
- [ ] Decode *401+RU function (liquid measure?)
- [ ] Establish full KH-exclusive vocabulary list
- [ ] Test if any KH terms appear in early (pre-LMIB) HT tablets
