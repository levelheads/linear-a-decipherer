## Problem Statement

*86+*188 compound (11 occ) dominates at Khania but is rare elsewhere. Why? Is this a site-specific marker, or commodity-specific (copper)?

## Key Finding: *86+*188 is a Khania Roundel Stamp

All 8 *86+*188 attestations at Khania appear on **roundels** (KHWc series: 2058-2117). These are small clay lumps sealed with a single impression, functioning as administrative receipts.

Critical observations:

1. ***86+*188 is the ONLY content** on 7 of 8 roundels (KHWc2058-2092). One roundel (KHWc2117) adds VIR+[?] (person marker).

2. **No commodity numerals**: Unlike tablets where signs are followed by quantities, these roundels have no numbers. The compound IS the receipt — it marks what was received/disbursed.

3. **Chronological range**: LMIB (most) to LMIIIA (KHWc2117), suggesting continuity across the LMIB destruction horizon.

4. **Not found on tablets**: The compound *86+*188 never appears on KH tablets, which instead use CYP (copper) grading systems (CYP+D, CYP+E, CYP+K).

## Comparison with CYP (Copper) System

KH tablets 6, 7a, 7b, 11 use an explicit copper grading system:
- CYP+D: copper grade D (most common)
- CYP+E: copper grade E
- CYP+K: copper grade K
- CYP (plain): ungraded copper

These tablets have quantities, personal names, and detailed accounting. The roundels with *86+*188 have none of this — they function differently.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Hypothesis A: *86+*188 = Commodity Type Marker

If *188 marks commodity type and *86 marks quantity class:
- We would expect *86 and *188 to appear separately with quantities → This IS observed at HT (standalone *188 and *86 with numerals)
- We would expect the compound to be decomposable → Partially supported (*188-*86 reverse order exists at HT8b)

**Assessment**: POSSIBLE

### Hypothesis B: *86+*188 = Administrative Function Marker

If the compound marks an administrative action (e.g., "received" or "disbursed"):
- Explains why it appears alone on roundels (the roundel itself IS the receipt)
- Explains why no quantities needed (the sealed impression authorizes a transaction)
- Parallels Linear B roundels which carry single ideograms marking transaction types

**Assessment**: PROBABLE — best fit for roundel evidence

### Hypothesis C: *86+*188 = Khania-Specific Commodity

If it marks a commodity unique to Khania's economy:
- Khania was a major trading port with connections to Egypt and the Levant
- A site-specific commodity (e.g., murex dye, textiles, perfumed oil) could explain localization
- But the lack of quantities argues against pure commodity marking

**Assessment**: POSSIBLE but less likely

## The *86 System at Khania

Beyond *86+*188, Khania also uses:
- **\*86-RO** (4 occ at KH): Note the -RO suffix — same as KU-RO! This may indicate *86-RO is a totaling/completion marker for whatever *86 represents.

This is significant: if *86-RO parallels KU-RO ("total"), then *86 may be a commodity/category and -RO marks its summation.

## Determination

1. ***86+*188 is an administrative function marker** (PROBABLE): Functions as a transaction stamp on Khania roundels, not a commodity label.

2. ***86 has dual function**: Standalone/suffixed on HT tablets (commodity?), combined with *188 on KH roundels (transaction type).

3. ***188 has dual function**: Standalone on HT tablets (category marker), combined with *86 on KH roundels (transaction qualifier).

4. **The *86+*188 system is Khania-dominant** because Khania's administrative apparatus used roundels extensively, while HT used tablets for the same functions.

5. **NOT related to copper**: The CYP system operates independently on KH tablets. *86+*188 roundels and CYP tablets serve different administrative purposes.

## Falsification Criteria

The roundel-stamp hypothesis (B) makes specific predictions that can be tested:

1. **If *86+*188 appears on a tablet with commodity numerals** → Hypothesis B is weakened (stamps should not carry quantities)
2. **If *86+*188 appears at a non-Khania site on a non-roundel** → The Khania-specificity claim is weakened, though hypothesis B could still hold
3. **If new Khania roundels are discovered WITHOUT *86+*188** → The compound is not the sole administrative stamp, weakening the "transaction marker" interpretation
4. **If the CYP grading system (*86+*188 independent) is shown to co-occur on the same roundel** → Hypothesis B and C are both weakened (separate systems should not mix)
5. **Counter-evidence threshold**: Finding >2 instances of *86+*188 with attached numerals would shift assessment to POSSIBLE or below

Currently unfalsified. The zero-numeral pattern across all 8 roundel attestations is the strongest positive evidence.

## Post-Analysis Verification

```
[1] KOBER: Was analysis data-led? [PASS] - Cataloged all attestations before hypothesizing
[2] VENTRIS: Was evidence forced? [PASS] - Tested 3 competing hypotheses
[3] ANCHORS: Built from confirmed anchors? [PASS] - Roundel function (Level 3: clear logogram)
[4] MULTI-HYP: All four tested? [PARTIAL] - Structural analysis; language hypotheses less relevant for logographic signs
[5] NEGATIVE: Absences considered? [PASS] - Absence of numerals on roundels is key evidence
[6] CORPUS: Verified across all occurrences? [PASS] - All 32 *188 and 24 *86 attestations
```

## Recommendations

1. Register *86+*188 as a Khania administrative stamp (Level 4 anchor: structural pattern)
2. Investigate *86-RO parallel with KU-RO totaling system
3. RE-*86 at Miletos: evidence of Khania administrative practices reaching Anatolia
