# Targeted Discovery: Is `SE-KA-NA-SI` a Productive Pre-`SI-RU-TE` Variant?

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Objective**: Find additional low-frequency ritual lines matching `... X SI-RU-TE` and test whether `SE-KA-NA-SI` is productive or a one-off.

## Search Scope

1. All corpus lines containing `SI-RU-TE`
2. All tokens ending with `-RU-TE` (to detect orthographic/lexical variants)
3. Ritual-like chains containing `JA-SA-SA-RA-ME` + `U-NA-KA-NA(-SI)` but lacking `SI-RU-TE`
4. All inscriptions containing `A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA` (to inspect structural endings)

---

## Findings

### 1. No additional `*-RU-TE` variants

Unique `-RU-TE` forms in the full corpus:

- `SI-RU-TE` only

No orthographic or lexical alternatives to `SI-RU-TE` were found.

### 2. Pre-`SI-RU-TE` slot remains extremely narrow

Across all 7 `SI-RU-TE` occurrences:

- predecessor `I-PI-NA-MA`: **5**
- predecessor `SE-KA-NA-SI`: **1**
- predecessor `<START>`: **1** (IOZa14 short line)

This means there are only **6** usable `X SI-RU-TE` cases, and `SE-KA-NA-SI` occupies exactly one.

### 3. Only one attested `SE-KA-NA-SI SI-RU-TE` line

- `SYZa3`: `A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA SE-KA-NA-SI SI-RU-TE`

No additional `SE-KA-NA-SI` + `SI-RU-TE` pairings were discovered.

### 4. Two likely truncated chain candidates (missing downstream segment)

Ritual-like inscriptions with `JA-SA-SA-RA-ME` + `U-NA-KA-NA-SI` but no `SI-RU-TE`:

- `IOZa9`: `JA-SA-SA-RA-ME U-NA-KA-NA-SI`
- `PKZa27`: `JA-SA-SA-RA-ME U-NA-KA-NA-SI`

These are compatible with chain truncation and do not provide alternative slot fillers.

---

## Interpretation

Current evidence supports:

1. **Productive slot filler**: `I-PI-NA-MA`
2. **Singleton variant**: `SE-KA-NA-SI` (currently one-off)
3. **No detected `SI-RU-TE` lexical variants** in corpus

So `SE-KA-NA-SI` should remain a **possible rare substitution**, not yet a productive variant class.

---

## Operational Decision

Until new attestations emerge:

- Keep slot model as:
  - primary: `I-PI-NA-MA`
  - rare/uncertain alternative: `SE-KA-NA-SI`
- Prioritize acquisition/analysis of additional SYZ/IOZ/TLZ ritual fragments where the chain may be incomplete.
