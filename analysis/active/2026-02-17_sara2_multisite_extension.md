# SA-RA₂ Multi-Site Search and S-R Root System

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Lane**: D (Language Asymmetry)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: Analysis complete — promotion NOT warranted

## Problem Statement

SA-RA₂ = Akkadian *sharāku* "allocate" is currently PROBABLE but entirely HT-exclusive. Multi-site attestation would elevate to HIGH. This analysis searches for non-HT evidence and tests the broader S-R root system hypothesis.

## SA-RA₂ Attestation Data

Total: 21 occurrences (20 SA-RA₂ + 1 A-SA-RA₂)

| Form | Occ | Sites |
|------|-----|-------|
| SA-RA₂ | 20 | HT (20) |
| A-SA-RA₂ | 1 | HT (1) |

**SA-RA₂ is 100% HT-exclusive.** No attestations at any other site.

## S-R Paradigm Search

Searching for vowel alternation patterns like the K-R system (KU-RO/KI-RO):

| Form | Occ | Sites | Multi-site? |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| SA-RA₂ | 20 | HT | No |
| SI-RU-TE | 7 | IO(3), KO(1), SY(1), TL(1), VRY(1) | **Yes (5 sites)** |
| SA-RU | 6 | HT | No |
| SA-RO | 4 | HT | No |
| SI-RU | 2 | HT(1), PK(1) | **Yes (2 sites)** |
| SA-RA | 2 | HT(1), SAM(1) | **Yes (2 sites)** |
| SA-RI | 1 | ZA | — |
| SI-RA | 1 | HT | — |

### Key Findings

1. **SA-RA₂ itself**: Entirely HT-exclusive. No non-HT attestation found anywhere in the 1,721-inscription corpus.

2. **SI-RU-TE**: Multi-site (5 sites) but exclusively at peak sanctuaries in the libation formula. This is RELIGIOUS register, not administrative like SA-RA₂.

3. **SI-RU**: Appears at HT and PK — the only non-religious S-R form outside HT, but only 2 occurrences (insufficient for promotion).

4. **SA-RA (plain, no subscript)**: HT + Samothrace. The Samothrace attestation is significant (extra-Cretan!) but it's a different form from SA-RA₂.

### Vowel Alternation Pattern

| Root | -A₂ | -U | -O | -A | -I |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| S-R | SA-RA₂ (20) | SA-RU (6) | SA-RO (4) | SA-RA (2) | SA-RI (1) |
| S-R (i-) | — | SI-RU (2) | — | SI-RA (1) | — |

The S-R root shows productive vowel alternation:
- SA-RA₂, SA-RU, SA-RO, SA-RA, SA-RI (5 vowel variants from S-R)
- SI-RU, SI-RA (2 variants with initial vowel change S→SI)

This parallels the K-R system (KU-RO, KI-RO, KA-RO, KU-RA, KI-RA), supporting a root-based morphological system.

## Hypothesis Assessment

| Hypothesis | Score | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Semitic (*sharāku*) | POSSIBLE | S-R biconsonantal root fits; vowel alternation parallels Semitic ablaut |
| Luwian | POSSIBLE | SA- prefix could be Luwian conjunction; but no clear verbal paradigm |
| Pre-Greek | WEAK | No substrate pattern match |
| Proto-Greek | NEUTRAL | No Greek cognate |

## Promotion Assessment

**PROBABLE → HIGH gate requirements** (per MASTER_STATE.md):
1. Strong cross-site behavior OR justified regional constraint ❌ (100% HT)
2. Integrated validation pass ❌ (no anchor registered)
3. No unresolved critical contradiction ✓

**Verdict: Promotion NOT warranted.**

SA-RA₂ fails the cross-site requirement. Its HT-exclusivity is a significant limitation. While the S-R root system shows productive morphology, the administrative form SA-RA₂ does not appear outside Hagia Triada.

### Mitigating Factor

SA-RA₂'s HT-exclusivity may reflect Hagia Triada's unique role as a central administrative hub. If SA-RA₂ is an allocation verb, it may only appear at sites that performed centralized redistribution. This would be a "justified regional constraint" — but the justification is circular (we assume it means "allocate" because it's at HT, and we excuse its HT-exclusivity because "allocate" would be an HT function).

### Circularity Caveat: SA-RA₂ vs S-R Root System

The evidence for SA-RA₂ = *sharāku* and the evidence for the S-R root system must be evaluated independently:

- **SA-RA₂ standalone evidence**: 21 HT-exclusive occurrences; list-position analysis; semantic fit with administrative context; Semitic biconsonantal root match. This evidence stands on its own but is regionally constrained.
- **S-R root system evidence**: Vowel alternation across SA-RA₂/SA-RU/SA-RO/SI-RU-TE; multi-site distribution (via SI-RU-TE); parallel structure with K-R system. This evidence is broader but does NOT confirm the Semitic interpretation — a productive root system is language-neutral.

**The S-R root system does not independently support the Semitic reading of SA-RA₂.** The root system proves morphological productivity; it does not prove which language family the root belongs to. Using multi-site SI-RU-TE attestation to argue for SA-RA₂ = *sharāku* would be fallacious: SI-RU-TE appears in religious contexts at sanctuary sites, a completely different register from SA-RA₂'s administrative function at HT.

## S-R Root System Assessment

The broader S-R paradigm IS multi-site:
- SI-RU-TE appears at 5+ sites (all sanctuaries)
- SI-RU at HT + PK
- SA-RA at HT + Samothrace

This suggests the S-R root is real and productive, even if SA-RA₂ specifically is site-restricted. The root may have both administrative (SA-RA₂, SA-RU, SA-RO at HT) and religious (SI-RU-TE at sanctuaries) functions — paralleling the K-R system's dual use.

## Post-Analysis Verification

```
[1] KOBER: Was analysis data-led? [PASS] - Full corpus search before conclusions
[2] VENTRIS: Was evidence forced? [PASS] - Acknowledged failure to find multi-site SA-RA₂
[3] ANCHORS: Built from confirmed anchors? [PASS] - K-R system (Level 2) as comparison anchor
[4] MULTI-HYP: All four tested? [PASS] - Semitic, Luwian, Pre-Greek, Proto-Greek
[5] NEGATIVE: Absences considered? [PASS] - Absence of SA-RA₂ outside HT is the key finding
[6] CORPUS: Verified across all occurrences? [PASS] - All 1,721 inscriptions searched
```

## Recommendations

1. SA-RA₂ remains at PROBABLE — no promotion
2. Register S-R root paradigm as a structural anchor (Level 5: morphological pattern)
3. Investigate SA-RA at Samothrace for contact-layer evidence
4. Compare S-R and K-R vowel alternation systems for systematic morphological description
