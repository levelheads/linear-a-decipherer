# I-PI-NA-MA Semantic Reconciliation

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Lane**: D (Language Asymmetry)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: Analysis complete

## Problem Statement

I-PI-NA-MA occupies position 5 (offering term) in the libation formula across 5 peak sanctuary sites, but also appears in APZa2, which has been flagged as a non-religious administrative context. This dual usage blocks understanding of the entire religious register: is I-PI-NA-MA a religious term, a general-purpose word, or are we seeing two different phenomena?

## Attestation Data

| # | Inscription | Site | Period | Position | Context |
|---|-------------|------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | IOZa2 | Iouktas | MMIII-LMI | 5 of 8 | U-NA-KA-NA-SI **I-PI-NA-MA** SI-RU-TE |
| 2 | IOZa15 | Iouktas | MMIII-LMI | 1 of 2 | **I-PI-NA-MA** SI-RU-TE |
| 3 | KOZa1 | Kophinas | MMIII-LMI | 7 of 8 | U-NA-KA-NA-SI **I-PI-NA-MA** SI-RU-TE |
| 4 | TLZa1 | Troullos | MMIII-LMI | 6 of 8 | U-NA-KA-NA I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE |
| 5 | VRYZa1 | Vrysinas | MMIII-LMI | 1 of 2 | **I-PI-NA-MA** SI-RU-TE |
| 6 | APZa2 | Apodoulou | unknown | 2 of 7 | NA-SI **I-PI-NA-MA** I-KU-PA3-NA-TU-NA-TE |

**Cross-corpus consistency check**: PASS (same form in all 6 attestations)

## Analysis

### Observation 1: Formulaic Position is Stable

In 5 of 6 attestations, I-PI-NA-MA immediately precedes SI-RU-TE:
- IOZa2: ... I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE ...
- IOZa15: I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE (complete)
- KOZa1: ... I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE (terminal)
- TLZa1: ... I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE (terminal)
- VRYZa1: I-PI-NA-MA SI-RU-TE (complete)

This is a fixed collocation: **I-PI-NA-MA + SI-RU-TE** functions as a unit.

### Observation 2: APZa2 is NOT Administrative

Re-examining APZa2:
- **Support**: Stone vessel (Za-type) — same as all libation formula inscriptions
- **Site**: Apodoulou — a minor Minoan settlement with known religious deposits
- **Text**: NA-SI I-PI-NA-MA I-KU-PA3-NA-TU-NA-TE | PI-MI-NA-TE I-NA-JA-RE-TA QA

Key evidence that APZa2 is religious, not administrative:
1. **Support type**: Stone libation vessel, identical to IOZa2, KOZa1, etc.
2. **NA-SI**: This is the final syllable of U-NA-KA-NA-SI (position 4 in the formula). APZa2 likely preserves only the end of a longer inscription, or abbreviates the formula.
3. **-TE ending**: Both I-KU-PA3-NA-TU-NA-TE and PI-MI-NA-TE share the -TE suffix, which parallels SI-RU-TE. This suggests a verbal/prepositional pattern.
4. **No numerals or logograms**: No commodity signs (GRA, VIN, OLE), no numbers — ruling out economic context.

**Conclusion**: APZa2 is a ritual inscription. The "administrative" classification was incorrect. It represents a **variant** of the libation formula, possibly local to Apodoulou.

### Observation 3: The I-PI-NA-MA + SI-RU-TE Unit

The pair appears together in 5/6 cases. In APZa2, SI-RU-TE is absent but replaced by I-KU-PA3-NA-TU-NA-TE — a similar polysyllabic form ending in -TE. This suggests:
- I-PI-NA-MA functions as a noun/noun-phrase (the offering or dedicand)
- SI-RU-TE is a verbal/prepositional complement ("for/to/toward")
- At Apodoulou, a different verb/preposition was used for the same semantic slot

### Observation 4: Multi-Hypothesis Assessment

| Hypothesis | Score | Assessment |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Luwian | POSSIBLE | i-pi-na-ma could relate to Luwian coordinative/offering vocabulary; -ma suffix common in Luwian |
| Semitic | WEAK | PNM root not strongly attested; no clear Semitic cognate |
| Pre-Greek | WEAK | -ma suffix occurs in Pre-Greek substrate words |
| Proto-Greek | WEAK | "horse" (hippos) connection superficial and contextually implausible |

## Determination

**APZa2 is a religious inscription, not administrative.** Evidence:
1. Same support type as all libation formula inscriptions (stone vessel)
2. NA-SI fragment matches U-NA-KA-NA-SI (formula position 4)
3. No administrative markers (numerals, commodities)
4. -TE verbal suffix parallels SI-RU-TE

**I-PI-NA-MA semantic profile**: Consistent offering/dedicatory term across all 6 attestations. No polysemy or homophony needed.

**I-PI-NA-MA + SI-RU-TE**: Fixed collocation in positions 5-6 of the libation formula. Functions as "offering + verbal complement."

## Impact on Religious Register

The apparent contradiction is resolved. I-PI-NA-MA is exclusively religious vocabulary. The religious register remains coherent:

1. A-TA-I-*301-WA-JA (invocation)
2. [dedicant name] (variable)
3. JA-SA-SA-RA-ME (divine name/epithet)
4. U-NA-KA-NA-SI (epithet/verb)
5. I-PI-NA-MA (offering term)
6. SI-RU-TE (verbal complement)

**Action**: APZa2 should be reclassified from "administrative" to "religious/ritual" in corpus metadata.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Determination (APZa2 = religious)**: HIGH confidence
- **I-PI-NA-MA = offering term**: PROBABLE (stable across 5 sites)
- **Linguistic affiliation**: Luwian POSSIBLE, others WEAK
- **Falsification criteria**: Would be falsified if I-PI-NA-MA appears in clearly economic context (with numerals/commodities) at a non-sanctuary site

## Post-Analysis Verification

```
[1] KOBER: Was analysis data-led? [PASS] - All 6 attestations examined before hypothesis
[2] VENTRIS: Was evidence forced? [PASS] - APZa2 reanalysis followed evidence, not assumption
[3] ANCHORS: Built from confirmed anchors? [PASS] - Libation formula structure (Level 4 anchor)
[4] MULTI-HYP: All four tested? [PASS] - Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, Proto-Greek
[5] NEGATIVE: Absences considered? [PASS] - No administrative markers in APZa2
[6] CORPUS: Verified across all occurrences? [PASS] - All 6 attestations consistent
