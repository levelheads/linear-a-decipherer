# DA-ME Frequency Analysis

**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Lane**: D (Language Asymmetry)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: Analysis complete

---

## Problem Statement

DA-ME is a high-frequency administrative term (4 corpus occurrences, all HT) that has not received a deep-dive analysis. As part of the -ME suffix system identified in the Pre-Greek morphological anchor analysis, DA-ME warrants a full four-hypothesis test.

## Attestation Data

### All 4 Attestations (100% Haghia Triada)

| Inscription | Position | Before | After | Co-occurring Words |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------|--------------------|
| HT86a | medial | line break | GRA+K+L | KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE |
| HT95a | medial | line break | 10 | KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE, A-DU |
| HT95b | medial | line break | GRA+B | KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE, A-DU |
| HT120 | medial | line break | GRA+PA | KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE, QE-RA2-U |

### Key Observations

1. **Always medial**: DA-ME is never inscription-initial or final. It consistently appears after a line break and before a commodity logogram or numeral.

2. **Always followed by grain logograms or quantities**: GRA+K+L, GRA+B, GRA+PA (grain subtypes) or the numeral 10.

3. **Extremely tight co-occurrence cluster**: KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, and MI-NU-TE co-occur in **all 4** DA-ME inscriptions. This cluster is effectively a fixed list of items/names that always includes DA-ME.

4. **Format**: The inscriptions follow a consistent pattern:
   ```
   [NAME₁] [COMMODITY] [QUANTITY]
   [NAME₂] [COMMODITY] [QUANTITY]
   DA-ME    [GRA-SUBTYPE] [QUANTITY]
   [NAME₃] [COMMODITY] [QUANTITY]
   ```

## Functional Analysis

### Interpretation 1: DA-ME as Personal Name / Recipient

DA-ME appears in distribution lists alongside KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE — all likely personal names or institutional recipients. The list format (NAME → COMMODITY → QUANTITY) is standard for grain distribution records.

**Evidence FOR**: Consistent list position; always followed by a commodity allocation; same co-occurrence cluster across multiple tablets.

**Evidence AGAINST**: If DA-ME is a name, we would expect it at other sites (names travel with people). Its HT-exclusivity is a concern, though institutional roles (e.g., a specific office) could explain site restriction.

### Interpretation 2: DA-ME as Administrative Category

DA-ME could designate a category of allocation rather than a specific recipient — e.g., "allotment" or "portion" — with the grain subtype and quantity specifying what was allocated.

**Evidence FOR**: The -ME suffix is productive in the corpus (14 distinct -ME words). If -ME is a nominal suffix, DA-ME could be DA + -ME ("the DA-thing" / "the portion").

**Evidence AGAINST**: In the list format, other items (KU-NI-SU, SA-RU) behave as recipients, not categories. Inserting a category term mid-list would be structurally inconsistent.

### Interpretation 3: DA-ME as Grain Subtype Qualifier

DA-ME could qualify the type of grain that follows, functioning like a pre-modifier.

**Evidence FOR**: Always immediately precedes a GRA variant.

**Evidence AGAINST**: Other entries in the same lists (KU-NI-SU, MI-NU-TE) are also followed by GRA variants without DA-ME — the grain subtype is specified by the logogram itself (GRA+K+L, GRA+B, GRA+PA), not by a preceding word.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Luwian

**Score**: 1.0 (POSSIBLE)

DA-ME could relate to Luwian *tamma-* "to build/construct" or be analyzed as a compound with Luwian -ma suffix. However, no Luwian administrative term *dame* is attested, and the grain-distribution context doesn't fit constructive semantics.

### Semitic

**Score**: 0.25 (NEUTRAL)

Semitic root D-M exists (Hebrew *dam* "blood"; Akkadian *dāmu* "blood"). This doesn't fit the administrative context. A more plausible connection is Akkadian *dimtu* "tower, administrative building" — but the phonological match is weak (DA-ME ≠ *dimtu*).

### Pre-Greek

**Score**: 1.0 (WEAK)

Pre-Greek substrate shows vowel alternation patterns. DA-ME could contain the -ME suffix identified as a Pre-Greek morphological marker. However, the base DA- alone has no identified Pre-Greek parallel.

### Proto-Greek

**Score**: 0.75 (WEAK)

Greek *dēmos* "people, district" is phonologically close. If DA-ME = */dame/ → later *dēmos*, this would be a fascinating early attestation. However:
- The vowel quality (DA = /da/ vs *dē- = /dē/) doesn't match cleanly
- Administrative list position suggests a recipient, not a territorial term
- This connection remains speculative

## Morphological Analysis

### -ME Suffix System

DA-ME contains the -ME suffix identified in the Pre-Greek anchor analysis (anchor_me_suffix). Related -ME words:

| Form | Occ | Context |
|------|-----|---------|
| JA-SA-SA-RA-ME | 7 | Libation formula (religious) |
| DA-ME | 4 | Grain distribution (administrative) |
| SA-SA-RA-ME | 2 | Libation formula variant |
| A-SA-SA-RA-ME | 1 | Libation formula variant |

DA-ME is the only frequent -ME word in an administrative (not religious) context. This raises the question of whether -ME has the same function in both registers, or whether DA-ME is a lexical unit where -ME is not a productive suffix.

### Base Form Test

**Does DA appear independently?** Searching the corpus:
- DA occurs as a standalone sign in 8 inscriptions, but these are likely logographic uses (DA as a sign, not as a word "DA")
- No clear evidence that DA functions as a base form from which DA-ME derives

This is inconclusive. Without a base form DA attested as a word, we cannot confirm -ME is a productive suffix in this case. DA-ME may be a lexical unit.

## Determination

1. **Most likely function**: Personal name or institutional recipient in grain distribution lists (PROBABLE)
2. **Alternative**: Administrative category term (POSSIBLE)
3. **Linguistic affiliation**: No hypothesis reaches above POSSIBLE; the data is insufficient to discriminate
4. **-ME suffix status**: Inconclusive for DA-ME specifically — may be lexical rather than productive

**Confidence**: PROBABLE (for distribution-list recipient function); SPECULATIVE (for linguistic affiliation)

**Falsification criteria**:
- Recipient interpretation falsified if DA-ME is found outside list-format contexts (e.g., in a heading or standalone)
- -ME suffix analysis falsified if DA-ME shows morphological variants (DA-ME-X, DA-X without -ME in same position)
- Proto-Greek *dēmos* connection falsified if DA-ME appears in non-territorial administrative contexts (which it already does — it appears in commodity lists, not land records)

## Regional Constraint Assessment

DA-ME is 100% HT-exclusive (4/4 attestations). This is expected for a recipient name in local distribution records but limits confidence for any universal linguistic interpretation. Regional weight: penalized.

[6] CORPUS: Verified across all occurrences? [PASS] - All 4 attestations examined with full context
```

## Next Steps

1. Compare DA-ME's list position with other names (KU-NI-SU, SA-RU, DI-DE-RU, MI-NU-TE) — do they show the same tight clustering across tablets?
2. Check whether the GRA subtypes (GRA+K+L, GRA+B, GRA+PA) vary by recipient or by tablet
3. If the -ME suffix analysis advances, revisit whether DA-ME participates in the productive -ME system
