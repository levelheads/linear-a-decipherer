### Key Observations

1. **Copper Dominance**: CYP (36) + CYP+D (17) + CYP+E (11) = 64 copper-related tokens
2. **Minimal Wine/Grain**: VIN (7) and GRA (8) are rare compared to HT
3. **High Fraction Usage**: 30 (½) + 13 (¼) + 11 (⅓) + 9 (1/16) + 6 (⅕) = 69 fraction tokens
4. **Unique Sign Compounds**: *301+*311, *86+*188, *411-VS appear frequently

## K-R Vocabulary Verification

### Corpus Search Results

| Term | HT Count | KH Count | Ratio |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| KU-RO | 32 | **0** | ∞ |
| KI-RO | 16 | **0** | ∞ |
| SA-RA₂ | 20 | **0** | ∞ |
| KU-RA | 2 (ZA) | **0** | ∞ |
| KI-RA | 2 (ZA) | **0** | ∞ |
| KU-RE | 2 (HT) | **0** | ∞ |

**CONFIRMED**: Khania has ZERO K-R administrative vocabulary.

### Implication

The Semitic administrative vocabulary (KU-RO = *kull*, KI-RO, SA-RA₂ = *šarāku*) may be:
1. HT-specific innovation
2. Trade-network specific (wine/oil redistribution)
3. Chronologically later development

Khania's copper trade may have predated or operated independently of the HT system.

## Commodity Distribution

### Full Commodity Table

| Commodity | Count | % of Commodities | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------------------|-------|
| **CYP** | 36 | 36.4% | Base copper |
| **NI** | 26 | 26.3% | Figs or measure |
| **CYP+D** | 17 | 17.2% | Copper grade D |
| **CYP+E** | 11 | 11.1% | Copper grade E |
| **GRA** | 8 | 8.1% | Grain |
| **VIN** | 7 | 7.1% | Wine |
| VIR+[?] | 6 | — | Personnel |
| OLE+TA | 5 | — | Oil type |
| VIR+KA | 5 | — | Personnel |
| VIR+*313b | 3 | — | Personnel |
| GRA+F | 2 | — | Grain type |
| VIR+*307 | 2 | — | Personnel |
| OLE | 2 | — | Oil base |

### Comparison to HT

| Commodity | HT Rank | KH Rank | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| CYP | 4th | **1st** | KH = copper trade center |
| VIN | 3rd | 5th | Less wine trade at KH |
| OLE | 2nd | 6th | Less oil trade at KH |
| GRA | 2nd | 4th | Similar grain usage |
| NI | 1st | 2nd | Figs important at both |

**Conclusion**: Khania specialized in **copper trade** while HT focused on **wine/oil redistribution**.

## CYP+D vs CYP+E Analysis

### Distribution

| Modifier | Count | Numeric Range | Co-occurrences |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| CYP+D | 17 | 1-3 (small quantities) | With fractions |
| CYP+E | 11 | 2-10 (larger quantities) | Without fractions |

### Hypothesis

**CYP+D** = Fractional copper unit (quality grade or weight subdivision)
**CYP+E** = Standard copper unit (integer quantities)

This parallels HT's OLE modifier system where OLE+U, OLE+KI, etc. indicate oil types/grades.

**Confidence**: PROBABLE

## KH-Specific Sign Inventory

### Unique Signs (≥5 occurrences)

| Sign | Count | Context | Proposed Function |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| ***411-VS** | 15 | Vessel sealings | Container content marker |
| ***164** | 13 | Roundels | Textile marker |
| ***301+*311** | 9 | Administrative | Commodity compound |
| ***86+*188** | 8 | Administrative | Unknown function |
| ***306** | 7 | Administrative | Commodity qualifier |
| ***401+RU** | 7 | Administrative | Liquid measure |
| ***301** | 5 | Administrative | (See Track B analysis) |

### Vessel Sealing System

Khania has a unique roundel/sealing system:

| Sign | Count | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| *411-VS | 15 | Vessel sealing type 411 |
| *409-VS | ~5 | Vessel sealing type 409 |
| *408-VS | ~3 | Vessel sealing type 408 |

These may indicate:
- Container types
- Content grades
- Origin/destination marks
- Quality certifications

---

## Structural Patterns

### Document Types at Khania

1. **Copper Tablets** (CYP + quantities)
   - Simple lists without KU-RO totals
   - Heavy fraction usage
   - CYP+D/CYP+E modifiers

2. **Vessel Sealings** (*4XX-VS series)
   - Roundel format
   - Single entry per seal
   - Associated with container marking

3. **Mixed Commodity** (GRA, VIN, NI)
   - Rare at KH
   - May be imports from HT system

### Comparison to HT Structure

| Feature | HT | KH | Interpretation |
|---------|----|----|----------------|
| KU-RO totals | Yes | **No** | Different accounting |
| KI-RO deficits | Yes | **No** | No deficit tracking |
| SA-RA₂ allocations | Yes | **No** | No redistribution marking |
| Multi-line lists | Common | Rare | Simpler documents |
| Fractions | Common | **Very common** | More precise measurement |
| Vessel sealings | Rare | Common | Trade marking system |

## Hypothesis Testing: Why No K-R Vocabulary?

### Hypothesis 1: Geographic Independence

KH (Kydonia, modern Chania) was a major port on the NORTH coast while HT was in the SOUTH. Trade routes and administrative needs may have differed.

**Evidence FOR**: Complete vocabulary independence; different commodity focus
**Score**: HIGH

### Hypothesis 2: Chronological Difference

KH may preserve OLDER vocabulary before K-R system developed.

**Evidence FOR**: Would need chronological dating confirmation
**Evidence AGAINST**: Both sites have LMIB inscriptions
**Score**: MEDIUM

### Hypothesis 3: Functional Specialization

KH handled EXPORTS (copper ingots) while HT handled DISTRIBUTION (internal redistribution).

**Evidence FOR**:
- Copper dominant at KH
- Vessel sealings = trade marking
- No deficit tracking needed for exports

**Score**: HIGH

### Hypothesis 4: Different Scribal Tradition

KH scribes may have used different training/conventions.

**Evidence FOR**: Unique sign compounds (*301+*311, *86+*188)
**Score**: MEDIUM

## First Principles Verification

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| P1 (Kober) | ✓ PASS | Patterns analyzed before interpretation |
| P2 (Ventris) | ✓ PASS | Zero K-R vocabulary documented |
| P3 (Anchors) | ✓ PASS | Building from commodity logograms (CERTAIN) |
| P4 (Multi-Hyp) | ✓ PASS | Four hypotheses for K-R absence tested |

## Summary for STATE_OF_KNOWLEDGE

1. **K-R Vocabulary ABSENT**: CONFIRMED across all 227 KH inscriptions
2. **Copper Specialization**: CYP represents 60%+ of commodity tokens
3. **CYP+D/CYP+E System**: Parallel to HT OLE modifier system
4. **Vessel Sealing System**: *4XX-VS series unique to KH
5. **Independent Administration**: KH operated parallel to, not subordinate to, HT
