## Six Principles Compliance

- [ ] **P1 (Kober)**: Internal structure before external comparison
- [ ] **P2 (Ventris)**: Testing, not guessing — falsifiable claims only
- [ ] **P3 (Anchors)**: New readings specify anchor level (1-6)
- [ ] **P4 (Multi-Hypothesis)**: All four hypotheses considered
- [ ] **P5 (Negative Evidence)**: Absent patterns documented
- [ ] **P6 (Cross-Corpus)**: Verified across all occurrences

> Mark N/A for principles that don't apply to this change type.
