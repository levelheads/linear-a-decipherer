## Research Motivation

<!-- What research question or workflow gap does this address? -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- Describe the feature or tool you'd like -->

## Six Principles Alignment

Which principles does this feature support?

- [ ] P1 (Kober): Internal structure analysis
- [ ] P2 (Ventris): Falsifiable hypothesis testing
- [ ] P3 (Anchors): Anchor-based expansion
- [ ] P4 (Multi-Hypothesis): Cross-hypothesis comparison
- [ ] P5 (Negative Evidence): Absence-based reasoning
- [ ] P6 (Cross-Corpus): Corpus-wide consistency checks

## Constraints

- [ ] I understand tools must use Python stdlib only (no third-party runtime dependencies)
- [ ] This feature works with the existing corpus format

## Alternatives Considered

<!-- Other approaches you considered and why this one is better -->

## Additional Context

<!-- Examples, mockups, references to scholarship -->
