# Linear A Decipherer

A rigorous methodology system for analyzing undeciphered Minoan Bronze Age inscriptions (c.1800-1450 BCE) from Crete.

## Overview

**Linear A remains undeciphered.** This project approaches it as an active research problem, not a solved puzzle.

The system uses a methodology derived from the successful Linear B decipherment to systematically analyze patterns, test competing linguistic hypotheses, and generate novel interpretations with calibrated confidence levels.

## Key Features

- **Evidence-based reasoning chains** - Every interpretation documented with explicit evidence
- **Multi-hypothesis testing** - All readings tested against Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, and Proto-Greek frameworks
- **Anchor-based expansion** - Building from confirmed toponyms and Linear B cognates outward
- **Corpus-wide verification** - Proposed readings validated across all occurrences
- **Calibrated confidence** - Explicit uncertainty quantification for all claims

## First Principles

The system operates under six inviolable principles derived from Alice Kober's methodology and Michael Ventris's successful decipherment of Linear B:

1. **KOBER PRINCIPLE** - Let data lead; never start with language assumptions
2. **VENTRIS LESSON** - Abandon theories when evidence contradicts
3. **ANCHOR-BASED EXPANSION** - Build from certain to speculative
4. **MULTI-HYPOTHESIS TESTING** - Test ALL four linguistic hypotheses
5. **NEGATIVE EVIDENCE** - Consider what's absent, not just present
6. **CROSS-CORPUS CONSISTENCY** - Readings must work across entire corpus

## The Anchor Hierarchy

| Level | Type | Example | Max Confidence |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirmed toponyms | pa-i-to = Phaistos | CERTAIN |
| 2 | Linear B cognates + position | ku-ro at totals | HIGH |
| 3 | Clear logograms | VIN, OLE, GRA | HIGH |
| 4 | Structural patterns | Transaction signs | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Morphological patterns | -jo genitive? | LOW-MEDIUM |
| 6 | Lexical matches | ki-ro = deficit | LOW |

## Historical Context

- **Alice Kober (1906-1950)** - Established that pattern analysis must precede language assumptions
- **Michael Ventris (1922-1956)** - Deciphered Linear B by following methodology over preconception

Their methodology succeeded where decades of speculation failed. This project applies those lessons to Linear A.

## Epistemic Commitment

> "Linear A is undeciphered. Every claim requires evidence. Every interpretation requires humility."

The goal is not to "solve" Linear A quickly, but to incrementally build understanding through rigorous methodology.
