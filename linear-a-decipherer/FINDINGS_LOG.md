### SA-RA₂ = Akkadian šarāku (PROBABLE)

**Previous interpretation**: Possibly *še'u* "barley" (Semitic)

**New interpretation**: *šarāku* "to allocate, grant" (Akkadian)

**Evidence**:
1. Multi-commodity distribution (GRA, CYP, OLE) rules out commodity name
2. Always precedes logogram, never follows
3. Positional pattern matches allocation terminology
4. Phonological fit: šarāku → SA-RA₂ (with final syllable loss)
5. Gordon precedent: if KU-RO = *kull*, other Semitic terms plausible
6. Archaeological context: Hagia Triada was redistribution center

**Implications**:
- Confirms Semitic (specifically Akkadian) vocabulary in Linear A administrative texts
- Supports "loanword layer" interpretation (borrowed terms, not genetic relationship)
- Explains why SA-RA₂ appears with multiple commodity types

**First Principles Verification**: All 6 PASS

### KU-RO / KI-RO Relationship Clarified

**Previous assumption**: Complementary distribution (one or the other, never both)

**New finding**: Overlapping distribution; different accounting functions

**Evidence**:
- 5 inscriptions contain BOTH forms: HT 88, HT 94b, HT 117a, HT 123+124a, HT 123+124b
- KU-RO consistently = grand total (sum of entries)
- KI-RO serves multiple functions:
  - Header/category marker
  - Fractional/partial amounts
  - Deficit/remainder after total

**Functions identified**:
```
KU-RO = Σ (all entries) = GRAND TOTAL
KI-RO = partial amount OR amount outstanding

When both appear:
- KI-RO before list = "owed/outstanding category"
- KI-RO after KU-RO = "remaining/deficit from total"
- KI-RO within blocks = "partial/fractional allocation"
```

**Implications**:
- KU-RO and KI-RO are NOT in complementary distribution
- They serve different accounting functions within same document
- Vowel alternation (U/I) may signal different roots, not inflection

**Confidence**: HIGH (Level 2 anchor - Linear B cognate + consistent position)

### Vowel-Based Hypothesis Discrimination Pattern

**Finding**: Final vowel of Linear A words correlates with linguistic hypothesis support

| Final Vowel | Favors | Word Count | Example Suffixes |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **-U** | Semitic | 39 | -U, -DU, -RU, -SU, -NU, -JU, -TU |
| **-E/-O** | Proto-Greek | 65+ | -E, -O, -RO, -RE, -SE, -NE, -ME, -TO |
| -A | Neutral | Many | -RA, -NA, -TA (both hypotheses) |
| -I | Luwian (weak) | Some | -RI, -TI, -DI |

**Possible explanations**:
1. **Language Mixture**: U-words = Semitic loans; E/O-words = Aegean substrate
2. **Morphological Differentiation**: Vowel quality marks grammatical distinctions

**Status**: Insufficient evidence to distinguish between explanations

**Confidence**: LOW-MEDIUM

### Knossos Ivory Scepter (KN Zf 2) Analyzed

**Discovery**: 119 signs - longest Linear A inscription ever found

**Key findings**:
- Two separate inscriptions by different scribes
- Ring: ceremonial/religious style (no numerals)
- Handle: administrative style with numerals and fractions
- Mixed scripts: Linear A + Cretan Hieroglyphic signs (*180, *181)

**Significance**:
- 1.6% of entire Linear A corpus in single object
- First Linear A economic document from cult context (handle)
- Dual register (sacred + secular) on same object

**Status**: Framework complete; awaiting full transliteration from Anetaki II publication

### TY 3a Oil Distribution Analysis

**Finding**: Sophisticated oil accounting at Tylissos

**Details**:
- 68 entries, second longest tablet
- 8 distinct oil types (OLE+KI, OLE+U, OLE+MI, OLE+QIf, etc.)
- Mixed linguistic elements:
  - Semitic: A-DU (50%), A-DA
  - Luwian: KO-A-DU-WA (33%)
  - Pre-Greek: NE-KI (17%)

**Implications**:
- Regional administration as sophisticated as Hagia Triada
- Contact language hypothesis supported (Semitic + Luwian + Pre-Greek)
- No KU-RO totaling = distribution record, not inventory

### Contact Language Model Proposed

**Finding**: Linear A likely NOT simple monolingual system

**Proposed structure**:
- **Base**: Pre-Greek substrate (indigenous Aegean)
- **Administrative layer**: Semitic loan words (Near Eastern trade contact)
- **Religious layer**: Possible Luwian grammatical influence

**Evidence**:
- KU-RO = Semitic *kull* "all/total" (PROBABLE)
- KI-RO = Semitic "deficit" (PROBABLE)
- Low /o/ frequency (2.9%) argues against Proto-Greek
- Libation formulas show Luwian particles

### Proto-Greek Hypothesis Downgraded to WEAK

**Previous status**: Neutral/open

**New status**: WEAK

**Evidence against**:
1. Low /o/ frequency (2.9% vs. Greek higher)
2. KU-RO ≠ Linear B *to-so* for "total"
3. Absence of clear Greek morphology (-os, -on, -ōn)
4. Only pa-i-to confirmed (likely Pre-Greek substrate origin)

**Methodological note**: This follows P2 (Ventris Lesson) - abandon hypotheses when evidence contradicts

**File**: [analysis/completed/thematic/LINEAR_A_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md](../analysis/completed/thematic/LINEAR_A_COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS.md)

---

### Only One Level 1 Anchor Confirmed

**Finding**: pa-i-to = Phaistos is the ONLY confirmed Level 1 (toponym) anchor

**Implications**:
- All other readings are Level 2-6 (HIGH to SPECULATIVE)
- Anchor hierarchy essential to prevent overinterpretation
- Building systematically from this single certain point
