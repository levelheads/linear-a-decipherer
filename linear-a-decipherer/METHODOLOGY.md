# Linear A Decipherment Methodology

**Inviolable principles and operational procedures for Linear A analysis**

---

## Part 1: The Six Principles

These principles govern ALL operations. They derive from the methodology that successfully deciphered Linear B.

**Violating any principle invalidates the analysis.**

### Principle 1: THE KOBER PRINCIPLE

**Never start with a language assumption—let the data lead.**

> "Anyone who took a theory about the language as their starting point was doomed to failure. The single route to the finishing line was to find the patterns and deep symmetries inside the primary texts." — Alice Kober

Requirements:
- Analyze frequency distributions BEFORE hypothesizing language
- Map positional patterns (initial, medial, final) BEFORE semantic interpretation
- Language hypotheses are tested AGAINST patterns, never assumed

Self-check: *"Am I following the patterns in the data, or am I assuming a language?"*

### Principle 2: THE VENTRIS LESSON

**Be willing to abandon theories when evidence contradicts them.**

Michael Ventris believed Linear B encoded Etruscan until overwhelming evidence proved otherwise. He succeeded because he followed methodology over preconception.

Requirements:
- Hold ALL interpretations provisionally
- Treat contradicting evidence as MORE valuable than confirming evidence
- If a reading requires "exceptions," question the reading first
- Document what would falsify your current hypothesis

Self-check: *"Am I forcing evidence to fit my theory, or letting evidence shape my theory?"*

### Principle 3: ANCHOR-BASED EXPANSION

**Build outward from what's certain, not inward from speculation.**

Requirements:
- Identify ALL available anchors BEFORE novel readings
- Never skip anchor levels
- Never claim higher confidence than the anchor level supports
- Document which anchors support each reading

Self-check: *"Am I building from confirmed anchors outward, or from speculation inward?"*

### Principle 4: MULTI-HYPOTHESIS TESTING

**Always test Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, AND Proto-Greek readings.**

No single hypothesis has achieved decipherment. Therefore:
- EVERY proposed reading must be tested against ALL seven hypotheses
- Document which hypotheses the reading supports/contradicts
- If reading works under ONE hypothesis only → Max confidence: PROBABLE

Self-check: *"Have I tested this reading against ALL seven major hypotheses?"*

### Principle 5: NEGATIVE EVIDENCE

**What the script DOESN'T show is also informative.**

Key observations for Linear A:
| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Very few obvious Greek cognates | Probably not Greek |
| No clear Semitic triconsonantal patterns | Probably not Semitic |
| Limited visible inflection | Possibly isolating/agglutinative |
| Strong positional patterns | Sophisticated administrative system |

Self-check: *"What should I expect to see under this hypothesis that I'm NOT seeing?"*

### Principle 6: CROSS-CORPUS CONSISTENCY

**Readings must work across the entire corpus, not just one tablet.**

A reading is INVALID if:
- Works on one inscription but fails on others with same sequence
- Requires different values for same sign in different contexts
- Produces meaning on one tablet but gibberish on related tablets

Verification procedure:
1. Propose reading based on inscription X
2. Search corpus for ALL occurrences of sequence
3. Apply reading to EACH occurrence
4. IF consistent → Accept (with appropriate confidence)
5. IF inconsistent → REJECT or REVISE

Self-check: *"Does this reading hold across ALL occurrences in the corpus?"*

## Part 2: The Anchor Hierarchy

Build interpretations from established anchors outward. **Never skip levels.**

| Level | Type | Example | Max Confidence |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirmed toponyms | pa-i-to = Phaistos | CERTAIN |
| 2 | Linear B cognates + position | ku-ro at totals | HIGH |
| 3 | Clear logograms | VIN, OLE, GRA | HIGH |
| 4 | Structural patterns | Transaction signs | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Morphological patterns | -jo genitive? | LOW-MEDIUM |
| 6 | Lexical matches | ki-ro = deficit | LOW |

### Anchor Re-evaluation Protocol

Anchors are provisional. Triggers for review:
- Anchor term appears in unexpected context
- Cross-corpus verification reveals inconsistency
- New archaeological/linguistic evidence challenges basis

Review outcome options: CONFIRMED, DEMOTED (update all dependent readings), REJECTED (remove from confirmed)

---

## Part 3: Seven Hypotheses Framework

### 1. Luwian/Anatolian (Palmer, Finkelberg)

**Phonological mappings:**
- `a-` prefix ↔ Luwian conjunction
- `-wa-/-u-` ↔ quotative particle
- `ki-` ↔ `kui-` (relative pronoun)

**Morphological patterns:** `-ti`, `-nti` (verbal); `-ssa`, `-nda` (nominal)

### 2. Semitic - West Semitic/Akkadian (Gordon, Best)

**Method:** Extract consonants; compare to Semitic roots
- ku-ro → K-R → *kull* "total/all"
- ki-ro → K-R → "deficit/partial"
- SA-RA₂ → *šarāku* "allocate"

### 3. Pre-Greek Substrate (Beekes, Furnée)

**Phonological markers:** -nth-, -ss-, -mn- clusters; prothetic vowels

**Toponymic evidence:** Knossos, Amnissos, Tylissos (-ss-); Korinthos, Zakynthos (-nth-)

### 4. Proto-Greek (Georgiev, Mosenkis)

**Test administrative vocabulary:**
| Linear A | Greek candidate | Meaning |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| ku-ro | kyrios | lord/complete |
| ma-te | mētēr | mother |

**Note:** ELIMINATED (2026-02-17) — 2.8% Bayesian posterior, below 5% falsification threshold

### 5. Hurrian (Monti 2002, van Soesbergen 2017)

**Method:** Compare agglutinative morphology; test ergative patterns
- Hurrian uses SOV word order, ergative case system
- Test for -nni, -šše suffixes characteristic of Hurrian

**Note:** ELIMINATED (2026-02-17) — Bayesian posterior 0.101, falsification <5%

### 6. Hattic (Schrijver 2018)

**Method:** Compare isolating/prefixing patterns; test temple terminology
- Hattic is a pre-Hittite language isolate with prefixing morphology
- Very small comparative corpus limits testing

**Note:** ELIMINATED (2026-02-17) — Bayesian posterior <5%, falsification <5%

### 7. Etruscan (Facchetti 2001, Facchetti & Negri 2003)

**Method:** Compare Mediterranean isolate patterns; test phonological inventory
- Etruscan shares some Mediterranean substrate features
- Facchetti has retreated from strong affiliation claims

**Note:** ELIMINATED (2026-02-17) — Bayesian posterior <5%, falsification <5%

> **BREAKTHROUGH Note (2026-02-17)**: As of this date, only **Luwian** (STRONG, 35.0%) and **Semitic** (MODERATE, 17.5%) survive falsification. Proto-Greek, Pre-Greek, Hurrian, Hattic, and Etruscan are all ELIMINATED (<5%). All seven must still be tested for methodology compliance, but analytical focus should prioritize the two surviving hypotheses.

## Part 4: Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Source Acquisition

Primary databases:
1. **SigLA Database** - https://sigla.phis.me (palaeographical)
2. **University of Crete Ariadne** - https://ejournals.lib.uoc.gr/Ariadne/

Site codes: HT=Hagia Triada, KH=Khania, ZA=Zakros, PH=Phaistos, KN=Knossos

### Step 2: Sign Identification

For each sign:
1. Match against sign list (references/sign_list.md)
2. Assign AB number (GORILA classification)
3. Note variants; mark confidence (certain/probable/uncertain/illegible)

### Step 3: Phonetic Assignment

Apply Linear B values to homomorphic signs. Confidence levels:
- **High**: Identical to Linear B, confirmed by toponym matches
- **Medium**: Similar to Linear B, consistent with corpus
- **Low**: Differs from Linear B, value extrapolated
- **Unknown**: No Linear B cognate

### Step 4: Multi-Hypothesis Analysis

```
FOR each linguistic hypothesis H in {Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, Proto-Greek, Hurrian, Hattic, Etruscan}:
    1. Generate candidate reading using H's rules
    2. Search H's lexicon for matches
    3. Check morphological plausibility
    4. Assess semantic fit with context
    5. Score: P(reading | context, frequency, morphology)
OUTPUT: Ranked interpretations with reasoning chains
```

### Step 5: Corpus Verification

- Test proposed reading on ALL other occurrences
- Same sign = same value in all contexts
- Document corpus coverage

### Step 6: Documentation

For each interpretation document:
- Graphemic evidence (sign forms)
- Phonetic basis (Linear B cognate/extrapolation)
- Distributional evidence (frequency, positions)
- Morphological fit (which hypothesis)
- Semantic fit (archaeological context)
- Alternative interpretations
- Confidence level and novelty

## Part 5: Confidence Calibration

### Levels

| Level | Definition | Requirements |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| CERTAIN | Proven beyond reasonable doubt | Multiple independent anchors; cross-corpus consistency; no contradictions |
| HIGH | Very likely correct | Level 2-3 anchors; strong positional evidence |
| PROBABLE | Most likely correct | Good evidence; fits multiple hypotheses |
| POSSIBLE | Reasonable interpretation | Some evidence; alternatives exist |
| SPECULATIVE | Educated guess | Limited evidence; novel proposal |

### Automatic Downgrades

- Hapax legomenon (1 occurrence) → Max: POSSIBLE
- Damaged/uncertain signs → Reduce one level
- Single-hypothesis support → Max: PROBABLE
- Contradicts anchor → REJECT or flag for review

## Part 6: Pre/Post Flight Checklists

### Pre-Analysis Checklist (MANDATORY)

```
FIRST PRINCIPLES PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

[ ] I will analyze patterns BEFORE assuming a language [P1]
[ ] I am prepared to abandon my hypothesis if evidence contradicts [P2]
[ ] I have identified all available anchors [P3]
[ ] I will test against ALL seven linguistic hypotheses [P4]
[ ] I will consider what the data DOESN'T show [P5]
[ ] I will verify readings across the ENTIRE corpus [P6]

If any box cannot be checked → DO NOT PROCEED
```

### Post-Analysis Verification (MANDATORY)

```

    [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL] Evidence: ___

[2] VENTRIS: Was any evidence forced to fit?
    [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL] Evidence: ___

[3] ANCHORS: Were readings built from confirmed anchors outward?

ANY PARTIAL → Must document limitation explicitly
```

### Consequences of Violation

| Principle | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| P1 (Kober) | Analysis invalidated; restart with pattern analysis |
| P2 (Ventris) | Hypothesis must be revised or rejected |

## Error Recovery

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Source unavailable | Try alternatives; document gap |
| Conflicting readings | Present both; flag uncertainty |
| Sign unidentifiable | Mark [?]; note damage |
| No interpretation possible | State explicitly; don't force a reading |
| Potential breakthrough | Flag for significance; document thoroughly |

## Part 7: Quantitative Methods (2026 Additions)

### Falsification Thresholds

Explicit thresholds for hypothesis acceptance/rejection:

| Category | Range | Meaning | Action |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **ELIMINATED** | <5% | Indistinguishable from noise | Hypothesis rejected |
| **WEAK** | 5-15% | Possible contact layer | Test for specific borrowings |
| **MODERATE** | 15-25% | Possible genetic affiliation | Prioritize investigation |
| **STRONG** | >25% | Likely genetic relationship | Primary focus |

**BREAKTHROUGH Results (2026-02-17)**: 5/7 hypotheses ELIMINATED (<5%). Luwian STRONG (35.0%), Semitic MODERATE (17.5%).

**Tool**: `tools/falsification_system.py`

### Regional Weighting Formula

Addresses HT bias (63.4% of corpus):

```
weight = 1.0
if num_sites >= 2: weight += log2(num_sites) * 0.1   # Diversity bonus
if ht_concentration > 0.5: weight -= (ht_conc - 0.5) * 0.5  # HT penalty
weight = clip(weight, 0.3, 1.5)
```

Example: KU-RO at 39 HT tablets → ~0.75 weight (25% confidence penalty)

**Tool**: `tools/regional_weighting.py`

### Anchor Dependency Tracking

Every reading must register its anchor dependencies:

```
Reading → depends_on → [Anchor1, Anchor2, ...]
```

Cascade rules:
1. Reading confidence cannot exceed lowest anchor confidence
2. If anchor QUESTIONED → dependent readings flagged for review
3. If anchor REJECTED → dependent readings demoted to SPECULATIVE

**Tool**: `tools/anchor_tracker.py`

### Bayesian Prior Probabilities

Calibrated priors for hypothesis testing:

| Hypothesis | Prior | Posterior (2026-02-17) | Status |
|------------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| Luwian | 0.25 | 0.316 | **STRONG** |
| Isolate | 0.35 | 0.299 | Active null |
| Semitic | 0.15 | 0.130 | **MODERATE** |
| Hurrian | 0.05 | 0.101 | ELIMINATED |
| Pre-Greek | 0.20 | <0.05 | ELIMINATED |
| Proto-Greek | 0.05 | <0.05 | ELIMINATED |
| Hattic | 0.02 | <0.05 | ELIMINATED |
| Etruscan | 0.02 | <0.05 | ELIMINATED |

**Tool**: `tools/bayesian_hypothesis_tester.py`

### Negative Evidence Catalog

Canonical absences that constrain hypotheses:

| Pattern | Hypothesis | Status | Implication |
|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| /o/ at 2.9% | Proto-Greek | CERTAIN absence | ELIMINATED |
| Greek case endings | Proto-Greek | CERTAIN absence | ELIMINATED |
| to-so (Greek total) | Proto-Greek | CERTAIN absence | Different vocabulary |
| Triconsonantal morphology | Semitic | PROBABLE absence | Loans, not genetic |
| Ergative case markers | Hurrian | PROBABLE absence | No SOV/ergative pattern |
| Prefixing morphology | Hattic | PROBABLE absence | No consistent prefixes |
| Mediterranean isolate cognates | Etruscan | PROBABLE absence | No shared vocabulary |

**Data**: `data/negative_evidence_catalog.json`

### Integrated Validation Pipeline

All readings must pass through unified validator:

```
Raw hypothesis score
  → Apply regional weight
  → Apply negative evidence penalty
  → Classify via falsification thresholds
  → Calculate Bayesian posterior
  → Check anchor dependency constraints
  → Output: Methodology-compliant assessment
```

**Tool**: `tools/integrated_validator.py`

## Final Reminder

> "Linear A is undeciphered. Every claim requires evidence. Every interpretation requires humility. These principles exist because generations of scholars made the mistakes they prevent."

**When in doubt, return to the Six Principles.**
