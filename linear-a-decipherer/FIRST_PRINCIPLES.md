# FIRST PRINCIPLES

## Status: INVIOLABLE

These six principles govern ALL operations of the Linear A Decipherer skill. They are derived from the methodology that successfully deciphered Linear B and represent hard-won lessons from decades of failed attempts.

**Violating any principle invalidates the analysis.**

---

## Principle 1: THE KOBER PRINCIPLE

### Statement
**Never start with a language assumption—let the data lead.**

### Source
Alice Kober (1906-1950), whose methodology enabled the Linear B decipherment:

> "Anyone who took a theory about the language as their starting point was doomed to failure. The single route to the finishing line was to find the patterns and deep symmetries inside the primary texts."

### Requirements
- [ ] Analyze frequency distributions BEFORE hypothesizing language
- [ ] Map positional patterns (initial, medial, final) BEFORE semantic interpretation
- [ ] Identify inflection patterns through distribution, not assumed morphology
- [ ] Language hypotheses are tested AGAINST patterns, never assumed

### Violation Indicators
- Starting analysis by asking "what would this mean in [language]?"
- Fitting patterns to match a preconceived language theory
- Ignoring distributional evidence that contradicts a hypothesis

### Self-Check Question
**"Am I following the patterns in the data, or am I assuming a language?"**

---

## Principle 2: THE VENTRIS LESSON

### Statement
**Be willing to abandon theories when evidence contradicts them.**

### Source
Michael Ventris (1922-1956) believed Linear B encoded Etruscan until overwhelming evidence proved otherwise. He succeeded because he followed methodology over preconception.

### Requirements
- [ ] Hold ALL interpretations provisionally
- [ ] Treat contradicting evidence as MORE valuable than confirming evidence
- [ ] If a reading requires "exceptions," question the reading first
- [ ] Document what would falsify your current hypothesis

### Violation Indicators
- Explaining away contradictions rather than revising the hypothesis
- Accumulating "special cases" to preserve a reading
- Emotional attachment to a particular interpretation
- Refusing to consider alternatives

### Self-Check Question
**"Am I forcing evidence to fit my theory, or letting evidence shape my theory?"**

---

## Principle 3: ANCHOR-BASED EXPANSION

### Statement
**Build outward from what's certain, not inward from speculation.**

### Source
Standard decipherment practice: establish anchor points, then extend systematically.

### Anchor Hierarchy (STRICT ORDER)

| Level | Type | Example | Max Confidence |
|-------|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Confirmed toponyms | pa-i-to = Phaistos | CERTAIN |
| 2 | Linear B cognates + positional verification | ku-ro at totals | HIGH |
| 3 | Clear logograms with pictorial origins | VIN, OLE, GRA | HIGH |
| 4 | Structural patterns | Transaction signs, totals | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Morphological patterns | -jo genitive? | LOW-MEDIUM |
| 6 | Lexical matches (single hypothesis) | ki-ro = deficit | LOW |

### Requirements
- [ ] Identify ALL available anchors BEFORE novel readings
- [ ] Never skip anchor levels
- [ ] Never claim higher confidence than the anchor level supports
- [ ] Document which anchors support each reading

### Violation Indicators
- Proposing a lexical match (Level 6) without establishing structural context (Level 4)
- Claiming CERTAIN confidence based on a single lexical parallel
- Ignoring available higher-level anchors

### Self-Check Question
**"Am I building from confirmed anchors outward, or from speculation inward?"**

---

## Principle 4: MULTI-HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### Statement
**Always test Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, AND Proto-Greek readings.**

### Source
No single linguistic hypothesis has achieved Linear A decipherment. Each has partial successes and failures. Privileging one is methodologically unsound.

### The Four Mandatory Hypotheses

1. **Luwian/Anatolian** - Palmer, Finkelberg
2. **Semitic (West Semitic/Akkadian)** - Gordon, Best
3. **Pre-Greek Substrate** - Beekes, Furnée
4. **Proto-Greek** - Georgiev, Mosenkis

### Requirements
- [ ] EVERY proposed reading tested against ALL four hypotheses
- [ ] Document which hypotheses the reading supports/contradicts
- [ ] If reading works under ONE hypothesis only → Max confidence: PROBABLE
- [ ] Note if reading works equally under multiple hypotheses

### Violation Indicators
- Presenting only one linguistic analysis
- Dismissing hypotheses without testing
- Claiming CERTAIN based on fit with one hypothesis

### Self-Check Question
**"Have I tested this reading against ALL four major hypotheses?"**

---

## Principle 5: NEGATIVE EVIDENCE

### Statement
**What the script DOESN'T show is also informative.**

### Source
Linguistic methodology: absence of expected patterns constrains hypotheses.

### Key Negative Evidence for Linear A

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Very few obvious Greek cognates | Probably not Greek |
| No clear Semitic triconsonantal patterns | Probably not Semitic |
| Limited visible inflection | Possibly isolating/agglutinative |
| Strong positional patterns | Sophisticated administrative system |
| No clear verbal morphology | Either lost or minimal verb system |

### Requirements
- [ ] Document what EXPECTED patterns are ABSENT
- [ ] Use absence to CONSTRAIN hypotheses
- [ ] Note when hypothesis predicts patterns not found

### Violation Indicators
- Focusing only on positive matches
- Ignoring that expected patterns are missing
- Not using absence to rule out hypotheses

### Self-Check Question
**"What should I expect to see under this hypothesis that I'm NOT seeing?"**

---

## Principle 6: CROSS-CORPUS CONSISTENCY

### Statement
**Readings must work across the entire corpus, not just one tablet.**

### Source
Verification standard for all decipherments: a valid reading is consistent everywhere.

### Requirements
- [ ] After proposing reading, IMMEDIATELY test on ALL other occurrences
- [ ] Same sign = same value in all contexts
- [ ] Meaning must make sense across all tablets containing the sequence
- [ ] Document corpus coverage for each reading

### Automatic REJECTION Criteria
A reading is INVALID if:
- Works on one inscription but fails on others with same sequence
- Requires different values for same sign in different contexts
- Produces meaning on one tablet but gibberish on related tablets

### Verification Procedure
```
1. Propose reading based on inscription X
2. Search corpus for ALL occurrences of sequence
3. Apply reading to EACH occurrence
4. IF consistent → Accept (with appropriate confidence)
5. IF inconsistent → REJECT or REVISE
```

### Self-Check Question
**"Does this reading hold across ALL occurrences in the corpus?"**

## Pre-Analysis Checklist

**MANDATORY before beginning ANY analysis:**

```
FIRST PRINCIPLES PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

□ I will analyze patterns BEFORE assuming a language [P1]
□ I am prepared to abandon my hypothesis if evidence contradicts it [P2]
□ I have identified all available anchors [P3]
□ I will test against ALL four linguistic hypotheses [P4]
□ I will consider what the data DOESN'T show [P5]
□ I will verify readings across the ENTIRE corpus [P6]

If any box cannot be checked → DO NOT PROCEED
```

## Post-Analysis Verification

**MANDATORY before finalizing ANY report:**

```
FIRST PRINCIPLES VERIFICATION

[1] KOBER: Was analysis data-led, not assumption-led?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Evidence: _______________

[2] VENTRIS: Was any evidence forced to fit?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Evidence: _______________

[3] ANCHORS: Were readings built from confirmed anchors outward?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Anchors used: _______________

[4] MULTI-HYP: Were ALL four hypotheses tested?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Results: Luwian___ Semitic___ Pre-Greek___ Proto-Greek___

[5] NEGATIVE: Was absence of patterns considered?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Absences noted: _______________

[6] CORPUS: Were readings verified across all occurrences?
    [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL / ⚠ PARTIAL]
    Corpus coverage: _______________

ANY FAIL → Analysis is INVALID
ANY PARTIAL → Must document limitation explicitly
```

## Consequences of Violation

| Principle Violated | Consequence |
|--------------------|-------------|
| P1 (Kober) | Analysis invalidated; restart with pattern analysis |
| P2 (Ventris) | Hypothesis must be revised or rejected |
| P3 (Anchors) | Confidence capped at anchor level reached |
| P4 (Multi-Hyp) | Confidence capped at PROBABLE maximum |
| P5 (Negative) | Missing constraints flagged; analysis incomplete |
| P6 (Corpus) | Reading REJECTED until verified |

## Final Reminder

> "Linear A is undeciphered. Every claim requires evidence. Every interpretation requires humility. These principles exist because generations of scholars made the mistakes they prevent."

**When in doubt, return to the First Principles.**
