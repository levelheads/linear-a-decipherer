# Administrative Grammar Reference

## Purpose

This document provides cross-linguistic reference data for analyzing administrative texts in Linear A. It supports the **Challenge 3** methodology: "Attack Linear A from Logograms Inward."

The key insight: The [X] position in `[X] + LOGOGRAM + NUMBER` patterns is **grammatically constrained**. By understanding how different language families mark grammatical roles in administrative contexts, we can test hypotheses without knowing vocabulary.

---

## Grammatical Roles in Administrative Texts

Administrative texts across languages share common semantic structures. The [X] slot before a commodity logogram typically expresses one of these roles:

| Role | Description | Example in English |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **RECIPIENT** | Who receives the commodity | "To John: wheat 10" |
| **SOURCE** | Where commodity comes from | "From Knossos: wine 5" |
| **AGENT** | Who provides/delivers | "John delivered: barley 20" |
| **BENEFICIARY** | For whom it's intended | "For the temple: oil 15" |
| **POSSESSOR** | Whose property it is | "John's wheat: 10" |
| **QUANTITY_MOD** | Amount specification | "Large wheat: 10" |
| **QUALITY_MOD** | Type specification | "Fine wheat: 10" |

## Case Marking by Language Family

### 1. Anatolian (Luwian)

**Source**: Melchert (2003), Yakubovich (2010)

| Role | Markers | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| RECIPIENT/DATIVE | `-si`, `-i`, `-a-si` | *massanassi* "to the god" |
| SOURCE/ABLATIVE | `-za`, `-ati`, `-ta` | *Wiyanawandaza* "from Wiyanawanda" |
| AGENT/NOMINATIVE | `-s`, zero | *wanattis* "the woman" |
| POSSESSOR/GENITIVE | `-sa`, `-ssa`, `-as-sa` | *Tarhunzassa* "of Tarhunza" |
| ADJECTIVAL | `-ja` (< *-iya*) | *massanassiya* "divine" |

**Key Pattern**: Dative `-si` is highly distinctive. Ablative `-za` is unique to Anatolian.

**Negative Evidence Expected**: If NOT Luwian, we should NOT see `-si` endings in recipient contexts.

### 2. Semitic (Akkadian, West Semitic)

**Source**: GAG (von Soden), CAD, Huehnergard (2011)

Semitic administrative texts rely primarily on **word order** rather than case endings.

| Role | Markers | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| RECIPIENT | Preposition *ana* "to" | Word-initial, not suffix |
| SOURCE | Preposition *ištu* "from" | Word-initial |
| AGENT | `-u`/`-um` nominative | Often unmarked in lists |
| POSSESSOR | `-i`/`-im` genitive | Suffixed genitive pronouns |
| ADJECTIVAL | `-u`/`-a` agreement | Gender/number concordance |

**Key Pattern**: Semitic typically uses **prepositions** rather than case suffixes. Administrative texts often use **construct state** (no overt marking) for possessives.

**Word Order Diagnostic**: Semitic is typically **VSO** (Verb-Subject-Object), though administrative lists may be nominal.

**Negative Evidence Expected**: If Semitic, we should see **word-initial** grammatical particles, not suffixes.

### 3. Pre-Greek Substrate

**Source**: Beekes (2014), Furnée (1972)

Pre-Greek grammar is largely unknown, but characteristic phonological patterns are identified:

| Pattern | Type | Examples |
|---------|------|----------|
| `-nth-` | Cluster | Korinthos, Zakynthos, labyrinth |
| `-ss-` | Geminate | Knossos, Tylissos, thalassa |
| `-mn-` | Cluster | Amnissos, Hymettus |
| `-nd-` | Cluster | Endemic pattern |

**Characteristic Suffixes**:
- `-inthos` / `-ynthos` (toponyms)
- `-assos` / `-issos` (place names)
- `-ene` / `-ena` (feminine?)

**Vowel Alternations**: Pre-Greek shows a/e and i/e alternation patterns not found in IE languages.

**Key Insight**: If Pre-Greek, morphology may be **non-IE** with agglutinative or isolating features. Case system (if any) is unknown.

### 4. Proto-Greek (Mycenaean)

**Source**: Ventris & Chadwick (1973), DMic

Linear B provides direct evidence for Mycenaean Greek grammar:

| Role | Markers | Linear B Examples |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| RECIPIENT/DATIVE | `-i`, `-oi`, `-ai` | *da-mo-ko-ro* → dative in *-oi* |
| SOURCE/GENITIVE | `-o`, `-as`, `-ao` | *wa-na-ka-te-ro* "of the king" |
| AGENT/NOMINATIVE | `-s`, `-os`, `-es` | *ko-re-te* "governor" |
| POSSESSOR/GENITIVE | `-o`, `-oio` | *ti-ri-po-de* "of tripods" |
| ADJECTIVAL | `-os`, `-a`, `-on` | *me-zo* "greater" |

**Linear B Administrative Patterns**:
```
[PERSON/PLACE] + COMMODITY + NUMBER + (TOTAL)
a-mi-ni-so   VIN   10   (from Amnisos: wine 10)
```

**Key Insight**: Greek has distinctive **vowel-final** case endings. The very low frequency of /o/ in Linear A (~3%) vs Greek expectations (~20%) is **negative evidence** against Greek.

---

## Linear B Comparative Vocabulary

Administrative terms confirmed in Linear B that may have Linear A cognates:

| Linear B | Greek | Meaning | Function |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| `to-so` | τόσος | "so much" | TOTAL |
| `o-pe-ro` | ὀφείλω | "owed/deficit" | DEFICIT |
| `do-e-ro` | δοῦλος | "servant" | PERSONNEL |
| `ko-re-te` | κόρητος | "governor" | TITLE |
| `da-mo` | δῆμος | "village/district" | PLACE |
| `pa-ro` | παρά | "from/by" | SOURCE marker |

**Linear A Candidates**:
- `ku-ro` - Totaling function (cf. Semitic *kull* "all"?)
- `ki-ro` - Deficit function (cf. Greek χρέος "debt"? Semitic *gara* "diminish"?)

---

## Word Order Typology

| Language | Basic Order | Admin Text Pattern |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Luwian | SOV | COMMODITY + NUMBER + RECIPIENT |
| Akkadian | VSO/SVO | RECIPIENT + COMMODITY + NUMBER |
| Greek | SVO | RECIPIENT + COMMODITY + NUMBER |
| Unknown | ? | Analyze positional distribution |

**Diagnostic**: If Linear A [X] words appear predominantly **before** logograms, this favors SVO/SOV. If **after**, may indicate VSO or head-final syntax.

---

## Expected Distributions by Role

Based on cross-linguistic administrative text analysis:

| Role | Expected Frequency | Position |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| RECIPIENT | High (30-40%) | Early in entry |
| POSSESSOR | Medium (20-30%) | Variable |
| AGENT | Low (10-20%) | Header position |
| SOURCE | Low (10-15%) | Early or header |
| BENEFICIARY | Low (5-10%) | Post-commodity |
| QUALITY_MOD | Low (5-10%) | Adjacent to logogram |
| QUANTITY_MOD | Low (5-10%) | Adjacent to numeral |

## Case Marker Discrimination Tests

### Test 1: Dative Markers

| Hypothesis | Predicted Marker | If Found |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Luwian | `-si`, `-i` | Strong support |
| Greek | `-i`, `-oi`, `-ai` | Partial support |
| Semitic | Word-initial *la-* | Strong support |
| Pre-Greek | Unknown | Neutral |

**Discriminating Pattern**: Luwian `-si` is highly distinctive. If 30%+ of RECIPIENT-role words end in `-SI`, this strongly favors Luwian.

### Test 2: Genitive/Possessive Markers

| Hypothesis | Predicted Marker | If Found |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Luwian | `-sa`, `-ssa` | Strong support |
| Greek | `-o`, `-oio`, `-ao` | Strong support |
| Semitic | `-i`, `-im` | Moderate support |
| Pre-Greek | `-ss-` cluster? | Weak support |

**Discriminating Pattern**: Greek genitive in `-o` is distinctive. Linear A's low /o/ frequency argues against this.

### Test 3: Ablative/Source Markers

| Hypothesis | Predicted Marker | If Found |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Luwian | `-za`, `-ati` | Very strong support |
| Greek | `-then`, `-tos` | Strong support |
| Semitic | Preposition | Strong support |
| Pre-Greek | Unknown | Neutral |

**Discriminating Pattern**: Luwian `-za` is unique. Any `-ZA` final syllables in SOURCE contexts would be significant.

---

## Negative Evidence Checklist

Check for **absence** of expected patterns:

### If NOT Luwian:
- [ ] No `-si` in recipient positions
- [ ] No `-za` in source positions
- [ ] No `-ssa` in possessive positions

### If NOT Greek:
- [ ] Low /o/ frequency (confirmed: ~3% vs expected ~20%)
- [ ] No clear diphthongs (-ai, -ei, -oi)
- [ ] No `to-so` totaling term

### If NOT Semitic:
- [ ] No evidence of triconsonantal roots
- [ ] No word-initial grammatical particles
- [ ] No VSO word order evidence

### If NOT Pre-Greek:
- [ ] No characteristic `-nth-`, `-ss-` clusters
- [ ] No a/e vowel alternation patterns

## Application to Linear A Analysis

### Step 1: Extract Commodity Slots
Identify all instances of `[X] + LOGOGRAM + NUMBER` patterns.

### Step 2: Analyze Suffix Distribution
For each [X] word, extract the final syllable as potential case marker.

### Step 3: Match Against Predictions
Test final syllables against the case marker predictions above.

### Step 4: Calculate Match Rates
For each hypothesis, what percentage of slot words match predicted markers for each role?

### Step 5: Check Consistency (First Principle #6)
Do matched words behave consistently across the corpus?

### Step 6: Apply Negative Evidence (First Principle #5)
Note which expected patterns are **absent**.

---

## Breakthrough Criteria

The analysis achieves a **potential breakthrough** if:

1. **Strong discrimination**: One hypothesis shows 65%+ match rate vs 30% for others
2. **Consistent role assignment**: [X] position shows consistent case marking (e.g., dative)
3. **Morphological pattern**: Recurring suffix emerges on 40%+ of slot words
4. **Convergent evidence**: Multiple independent tests favor the same hypothesis
5. **Negative confirmation**: Other hypotheses' expected patterns are systematically absent
