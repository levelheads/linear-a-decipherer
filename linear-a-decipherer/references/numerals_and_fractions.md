# Linear A Numerals and Fractions

Comprehensive documentation of the Linear A numerical system, including Silvia Ferrara's 2020 breakthrough research on sexagesimal fractions.

> **⚠️ FIRST PRINCIPLE #3**: Numerical values are high-confidence ANCHORS. Integers and logograms counting commodities provide structural grounding for administrative text analysis. Build interpretations outward from verified numerical totals.

## Overview

Linear A uses a **decimal integer system** combined with a **complex fractional notation**. The numerical system is one of the most securely understood aspects of Linear A, providing critical anchors for analyzing administrative texts.

## Integer Notation (Decimal System)

Linear A integers follow a **decimal (base-10)** system with additive notation.

### Basic Integer Signs

| Symbol | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| \| | 1 | Vertical stroke |
| — | 10 | Horizontal stroke |
| ○ | 100 | Circle (open) |
| ◎ | 1000 | Circle with dot/double circle |

### Reading Integers

Numbers are written additively, typically read left-to-right within a numeral cluster:

```
○ — — — | | |     = 100 + 30 + 3 = 133
◎ ○ ○ — — — — |   = 1000 + 200 + 40 + 1 = 1241
```

### Verification via KU-RO Totals

The meaning of integer signs is confirmed through administrative tablets where KU-RO (total) precedes a sum matching preceding entries:

**Example**: HT 13
- Individual commodity entries sum to total at KU-RO line
- Mathematical consistency across tablets confirms decimal reading

**Cross-reference**: See CONFIRMED_READINGS.md for KU-RO verification methodology.

## Fraction Notation

### Ferrara's 2020 Breakthrough

Silvia Ferrara's landmark 2020 study revealed that Linear A fractions follow a **sexagesimal-related** system where most values are expressed as **n/60**.

**Key findings**:
- Smallest attested fraction: **1/60**
- Most fractions expressible as multiples of 1/60
- System shows Mesopotamian influence but adapted for Minoan use
- Linear A's 1/10 evolved into Linear B capacity unit

### INSCRIBE Project Context

Ferrara's research emerged from the **INSCRIBE Project** (Investigation of Scripts and Undeciphered Languages) at the University of Bologna, which applies systematic methodologies to undeciphered Bronze Age scripts.

## Fraction Sign Inventory

The following signs represent fractional values. Note that exact values remain debated for some signs.

### Commonly Attested Fractions

| Sign | AB # | Proposed Value | Ferrara 2020 Value | Frequency | Notes |
|------|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| J | AB 164 | 1/4 | ~15/60 = 1/4 | High | Most common fraction |
| E | AB 162 | 1/2 | ~30/60 = 1/2 | High | Half-unit |
| F | AB 163 | 1/3? | ~20/60 = 1/3 | Medium | Third-unit candidate |
| K | AB 165 | 1/8? | ~7.5/60 | Medium | Eighth or smaller |
| L | AB 166 | Small fraction | Variable | Low | Context-dependent |

### Fraction Sign Distribution by Context

| Context | Common Fractions | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Commodity measures | J, E | Liquid measures (OLE, VIN) |
| Grain accounts | E, F | Dry measures (GRA) |
| Wool/textile | J, K | Weight measures? |
| Mixed accounts | Various | Multiple fraction types together |

### Identification Criteria

Fraction signs are identified by:
1. **Position**: Follow commodity logograms and integers
2. **Form**: Distinctive curved or compound shapes
3. **Context**: Mathematical plausibility when summed
4. **Linear B parallels**: Some signs correspond to Linear B fractions

## Cross-Corpus Fraction Distribution

### By Site

| Site | Tablets with Fractions | Primary Fraction Types | Notes |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| HT (Hagia Triada) | 47+ | J, E, F | Most extensive fraction corpus |
| KH (Khania) | 23+ | J, E | Similar to HT patterns |
| ZA (Zakros) | 12+ | E, J | Less variety |
| PH (Phaistos) | 8+ | E | Archaic forms |
| KN (Knossos) | 15+ | J, E, K | Includes 2024 scepter |

### By Document Type

| Type | Fraction Usage | Commodities |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Commodity lists | Very frequent | OLE, VIN, GRA, FIC |
| Personnel records | Rare | — |
| Religious/libation | Absent | — |
| Seal impressions | Absent | — |

## KN Zg 58: Knossos Scepter Handle Fractions

The 2024 Knossos ivory scepter discovery (KN Zg 57/58) includes the **administrative inscription** on the handle (KN Zg 58) which contains numerals and fractions.

### Preliminary Observations

**Status**: Full transliteration pending publication in "Anetaki II"

**Known features** (from Kanta et al. 2025):
- Administrative style (contrast with ritual ring KN Zg 57)
- Contains numerical notations
- Fraction signs present alongside integers
- Potential commodity logograms

### Significance

KN Zg 58 may provide:
- New fraction sign sequences for pattern analysis
- Additional KU-RO totaling examples
- Confirmation or refinement of fraction values

**Action**: Update this section when full transliteration published.

**Cross-reference**: See bibliography.md for Kanta et al. 2025 citation.

## Methodology for Identifying Fractions

### Step 1: Positional Analysis

Fractions typically appear:
- **After** commodity logograms (VIN, OLE, GRA)
- **After** integer quantities
- **Before** word dividers or next entry

```
[WORD] [LOGOGRAM] [INTEGER] [FRACTION]
sa-ru   OLE       | | |      J
```

### Step 2: Mathematical Verification

When multiple entries precede a KU-RO total:
1. Sum all integers
2. Sum all fractions separately
3. Verify total matches KU-RO line
4. If mismatch, reassess fraction values

### Step 3: Cross-Corpus Consistency

Proposed fraction values must:
- Produce plausible totals across multiple tablets
- Show consistent distribution patterns
- Not require ad-hoc exceptions

### Step 4: Linear B Comparison

Some Linear A fractions evolved into Linear B units:
- Linear A 1/10 → Linear B capacity measurement
- Comparative analysis confirms shared fractional concepts

## Sexagesimal Connection

### Why Base-60?

Ferrara's research reveals that while Linear A integers are **decimal**, fractions show **sexagesimal influence**:

| System Aspect | Base |
|---------------|------|
| Integer counting | Decimal (10) |
| Fraction expression | Sexagesimal-related (60) |

### Mesopotamian Parallels

The sexagesimal fraction system suggests cultural contact with Mesopotamia:
- Akkadian/Babylonian mathematics used base-60
- Trade connections between Crete and Near East documented
- Administrative practices may have been borrowed/adapted

### Minoan Adaptation

Linear A's system is **not pure Babylonian**:
- Integers remain decimal (unlike full Babylonian)
- Fraction signs are graphically distinct from Mesopotamian
- System adapted to Minoan commodity measurement needs

## Open Questions

### Unresolved Issues

1. **Exact fraction values**: Some signs (K, L) have disputed values
2. **Regional variation**: Do HT and KH use identical fraction systems?
3. **Temporal evolution**: Did fractions change from MMII to LMIB?
4. **Logogram-specific fractions**: Are certain fractions tied to specific commodities?
5. **KN Zg 58**: What new fraction data will emerge from the 2024 scepter?

### Research Priorities

| Priority | Question | Method |
|----------|----------|--------|
| HIGH | Verify F = 1/3 | Mathematical analysis of totals |
| HIGH | KN Zg 58 fractions | Await publication |
| MEDIUM | Regional comparison | Cross-site statistical analysis |
| LOW | Diachronic change | Compare early/late tablets |

---

## Practical Application

### When Analyzing Administrative Tablets

1. **Identify all numerical elements** before interpreting words
2. **Verify totals mathematically** to confirm reading accuracy
3. **Flag fraction uncertainties** when values unclear
4. **Cross-reference** with Ferrara 2020 for fraction interpretations

### Confidence Calibration

| Element | Max Confidence |
|---------|---------------|
| Integers (\|, —, ○, ◎) | CERTAIN |
| Common fractions (J, E) | HIGH |
| Debated fractions (F, K, L) | MEDIUM |
| Novel fraction proposals | LOW-SPECULATIVE |
