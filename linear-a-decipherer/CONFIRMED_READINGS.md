# Confirmed Readings

**Accumulating list of secure Linear A interpretations**

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-31

---

## Anchor Level 1: CERTAIN (Toponyms)

These readings are confirmed through geographic identification and Linear B correspondence.

| Word | Meaning | Evidence | Occurrences | Linear B |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **pa-i-to** | Phaistos | Geographic + Linear B pa-i-to | 12 | pa-i-to |
| **ku-do-ni-ja** | Kydonia (Chania) | Geographic + Linear B ku-do-ni-ja | 8 | ku-do-ni-ja |

**Requirements for Level 1**:
- Geographic identification with known site
- Linear B cognate with identical phonetic sequence
- Archaeological confirmation

---

## Anchor Level 2: HIGH (Linear B Cognates + Position)

Readings supported by Linear B correspondence AND consistent positional/functional evidence.

| Word | Meaning | Evidence | Occurrences | Position | Linear B |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **ku-ro** | total/sum | Position at section ends; sums verified mathematically; Linear B totaling parallel | 37 | List-final | to-so (function) |
| **ki-ro** | deficit/partial | Context after totals or as header; functions as accounting term | 16 | Variable | — |

**Requirements for Level 2**:
- Linear B cognate (phonetic or functional)
- Consistent positional pattern across corpus
- Mathematical or contextual verification

---

## Anchor Level 3: HIGH (Logograms)

Pictographic or ideographic signs with confirmed meanings.

### Commodity Logograms

| Logogram | Meaning | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| **GRA** | grain/cereal | Pictographic origin; Linear B GRA | Standard commodity |
| **VIN** | wine | Pictographic origin; Linear B VIN | Standard commodity |
| **OLE** | olive oil | Pictographic origin; Linear B OLE | Standard commodity; many ligature variants |
| **OLIV** | olives (whole) | Pictographic origin; Linear B OLIV | Distinguished from OLE (oil) |
| **FIC** | figs | Pictographic origin; Linear B FIC | Standard commodity |
| **FAR** | flour/barley | Linear B FAR | May indicate processed grain |
| **CYP** | copper/bronze(?) | Context with metal transactions | Interpretation less certain |

### Animal Logograms

| Logogram | Meaning | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| **OVI** | sheep | Pictographic origin; Linear B OVI | — |
| **CAP** | goat | Pictographic origin; Linear B CAP | — |
| **SUS** | pig | Pictographic origin; Linear B SUS | — |
| **BOS** | cattle | Pictographic origin; Linear B BOS | — |
| **VIR** | man/person | Pictographic origin; Linear B VIR | Often with qualifiers |

### Textile/Material Logograms

| Logogram | Meaning | Evidence | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| **TELA** | textile/cloth | Linear B TELA; Knossos scepter | Multiple fringe variants |
| **AB 180** | hide | Pictographic; Phaistos form | — |

**Requirements for Level 3**:
- Clear pictographic origin OR Linear B equivalent
- Consistent contextual usage

## Under Investigation (Not Yet Confirmed)

### Level 4-5: Structural/Morphological (PROBABLE to POSSIBLE)

| Word | Proposed Meaning | Confidence | Best Hypothesis | Blocking Issue |
|------|------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **SA-RA₂** | allocation (*šarāku*) | PROBABLE | Akkadian | No bilingual confirmation |
| **A-DU** | administrative term | PROBABLE | Semitic | Exact semantics unclear |
| **A-DA** | personal name/title | PROBABLE | Semitic | Limited contexts |
| **KO-A-DU-WA** | personal name | PROBABLE | Luwian | -WA suffix supports but not conclusive |
| **po-to-ku-ro** | grand total | PROBABLE | — | Limited attestations (~10) |
| **ja-sa-sa-ra-me** | divine name | POSSIBLE | Pre-Greek | Religious context only |

### Level 6: Lexical Speculation (SPECULATIVE)

| Word | Proposed Meaning | Hypothesis | Issue |
|------|------------------|------------|-------|
| **ya-ne** | wine (*yayin*) | Semitic | Single context; could be loan |
| **qa-pa** | vessel (*kappu*) | Semitic | Limited evidence |
| **ka-ro-pa** | vessel (*karpu*) | Semitic | Etymology uncertain |

## Rejection Log

Interpretations that have been tested and rejected:

| Word | Rejected Meaning | Why Rejected | Date |
|------|------------------|--------------|------|
| **SA-RA₂** | barley (*še'u*) | Appears with CYP (copper), OLE (oil) — not just grain | 2026-01-31 |
| **ku-ro** | Greek *kyrios* "lord" | Semantic stretch; Linear B uses *to-so* for totals | 2026-01-05 |

---

## Confidence Scale

| Level | Definition | Requirements |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **CERTAIN** | Proven beyond reasonable doubt | Multiple independent anchors; cross-corpus consistency; no contradictions |
| **HIGH** | Very likely correct | Level 2-3 anchors; strong positional/contextual evidence |
| **PROBABLE** | Most likely correct | Good evidence; fits multiple hypotheses or overwhelming single hypothesis |
| **POSSIBLE** | Reasonable interpretation | Some supporting evidence; alternatives exist |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Educated guess | Limited evidence; novel proposal |

---

## Promotion Criteria

To move a reading from "Under Investigation" to "Confirmed":

1. **Level 1 (Toponym)**: Geographic + Linear B + archaeological
2. **Level 2 (Cognate + Position)**: Linear B parallel + 10+ occurrences + consistent pattern
3. **Level 3 (Logogram)**: Pictographic OR Linear B + consistent context

**Automatic downgrades**:
- Hapax legomenon (1 occurrence) → Max: POSSIBLE
- Single-hypothesis support only → Max: PROBABLE
- Contradictory evidence → REJECT or flag
