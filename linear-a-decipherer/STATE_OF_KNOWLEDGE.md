## Quick Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Corpus Analyzed** | 8 / 1,721 inscriptions (0.46%) |
| **Confirmed Readings** | 2 toponyms + 2 administrative terms + 12 logograms |
| **Active Hypotheses** | 4 (Luwian, Semitic, Pre-Greek, Proto-Greek) |
| **Best-Fit Model** | Contact Language (Pre-Greek base + Semitic admin + Luwian religious) |

## Current Best Understanding

### Language Affiliation

**Status**: Undeciphered; no genetic affiliation confirmed

**Working hypothesis**: Linear A records a **contact language** with multiple linguistic layers:

| Layer | Evidence | Confidence |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Pre-Greek substrate** | Base vocabulary; toponym pa-i-to; low /o/ frequency | HIGH |
| **Semitic administrative** | KU-RO = *kull* "total"; SA-RA₂ = *šarāku* "allocate" | PROBABLE |
| **Luwian religious** | Particles in libation formulas (-wa-, -ja) | POSSIBLE |
| **Proto-Greek** | WEAK - lacks Greek morphology, wrong vowel distribution | LOW |

**Key negative evidence against Proto-Greek**:
1. Low /o/ frequency (2.9% vs. Greek higher)
2. KU-RO ≠ Linear B *to-so* for "total"
3. No Greek case endings (-os, -on, -ōn)
4. Only pa-i-to confirmed (likely Pre-Greek origin)

### Administrative Vocabulary

The **palace economy redistribution terminology** is the most accessible layer:

| Term | Meaning | Occurrences | Confidence | Etymology |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| **ku-ro** | total/sum | 37 | HIGH | Semitic *kull* "all" |
| **ki-ro** | deficit/partial | 16 | HIGH | Semitic (related to *kull*?) |
| **SA-RA₂** | allocation/grant | 20 | PROBABLE | Akkadian *šarāku* |
| **po-to-ku-ro** | grand total | ~10 | PROBABLE | Extended *ku-ro* |

**Key insight (2026-01-31)**: KU-RO and KI-RO are NOT complementary — they co-occur in at least 5 inscriptions with different accounting functions.

### Toponyms (Only Certain Readings)

| Toponym | Site | Evidence |
|---------|------|----------|
| **pa-i-to** | Phaistos | Linear B cognate + geography |
| **ku-do-ni-ja** | Kydonia (Chania) | Linear B cognate + geography |

These are the ONLY Level 1 (CERTAIN) anchors in the corpus.

### Logograms (Reliably Identified)

**Commodities**: GRA, VIN, OLE, OLIV, FIC, FAR, CYP
**Animals**: OVI, CAP, SUS, BOS, VIR
**Materials**: TELA (textiles), AB 180 (hides)

All confirmed via pictographic origin and/or Linear B equivalents.

## Hypothesis Scorecard

| Hypothesis | Administrative | Religious | Phonology | Morphology | **Overall** |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Semitic (loans)** | PROBABLE | WEAK | POSSIBLE | WEAK | **PROBABLE** |
| **Pre-Greek** | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | WEAK | **POSSIBLE** |
| **Luwian** | WEAK | POSSIBLE | POSSIBLE | WEAK | **POSSIBLE** |
| **Proto-Greek** | WEAK | WEAK | WEAK | WEAK | **WEAK** |

### Hypothesis Details

**Semitic (Akkadian/West Semitic)**
- Strengths: KU-RO, SA-RA₂, -U ending pattern, trade network evidence
- Weaknesses: No triconsonantal morphology; likely loans, not genetic
- Proponents: Gordon (1966), Best (1972)

**Pre-Greek Substrate**
- Strengths: Toponym origins, vowel distribution, language isolate plausible
- Weaknesses: Unfalsifiable; no comparative data
- Proponents: Beekes (2014), Furnée (1972)

**Luwian/Anatolian**
- Strengths: Particles (-wa-, -ja); Aegean contact; palatalized phonology
- Weaknesses: No clear case morphology; limited vocabulary matches
- Proponents: Palmer (1958), Finkelberg (1998)

**Proto-Greek**
- Strengths: Linear B scribal continuity
- Weaknesses: Low /o/; no Greek morphology; KU-RO ≠ to-so
- Proponents: Georgiev (1963), Mosenkis (2019)

## Open Questions

### High Priority

1. **Is the Semitic layer loanwords or genetic?**
   - Current answer: Probably loanwords (no triconsonantal morphology)
   - Needed: More vocabulary analysis; comparison with Mari/Ugarit texts

2. **What language family is the substrate?**
   - Current answer: Unknown (possibly isolate)
   - Needed: Systematic morphological analysis

3. **Can religious texts provide different vocabulary?**
   - Current answer: Possibly (libation formulas differ from tablets)
   - Needed: Challenge 4 implementation

### Medium Priority

4. **Do regional scribal traditions differ?**
   - Sites: HT (147), KH (99), ZA (31), PH (26)
   - Needed: Regional comparison study

5. **What do the vowel ending patterns mean?**
   - -U favors Semitic; -E/-O favors Proto-Greek; -A neutral
   - Needed: Determine if language mixture or morphological

6. **What is the Knossos Scepter telling us?**
   - 119 signs; ceremonial + administrative
   - Needed: Full transliteration from Anetaki II publication

### Low Priority

7. **Chronological changes MMII → LMIB?**
8. **Mixed script usage (Linear A + Hieroglyphic)?**
9. **Relationship to Cypro-Minoan?**

## Recent Discoveries (2026-01-31)

### SA-RA₂ = Akkadian šarāku

- **Finding**: SA-RA₂ is likely cognate with Akkadian *šarāku* "to allocate, grant"
- **Impact**: Strengthens Semitic administrative vocabulary hypothesis
- **Implication**: Multi-commodity distribution (GRA, CYP, OLE) explained

### KU-RO / KI-RO Relationship

- **Finding**: These terms co-occur in same inscriptions (not complementary)
- **Impact**: Different accounting functions, not simple opposites
- **Implication**: More sophisticated accounting than previously understood

### Vowel-Based Discrimination

- **Finding**: Final vowels correlate with hypothesis support
- **Impact**: Possible diagnostic for identifying Semitic vs. Greek elements
- **Status**: Needs more testing

## Methodology Summary

### What We Follow

1. **Kober Principle**: Patterns before language assumptions
2. **Ventris Lesson**: Abandon contradicted hypotheses
3. **Anchor Hierarchy**: Build from certain (L1) to speculative (L6)
4. **Multi-Hypothesis Testing**: All four frameworks for every reading
5. **Negative Evidence**: What's absent constrains interpretation
6. **Corpus Consistency**: Verify across all occurrences

### Current Research Phases
